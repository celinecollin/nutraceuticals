# Unverified Claims Tracker

**STATUS: UNVERIFIED TAGS RESOLVED; AUTHOR-CHECK ITEMS PENDING**

All `[UNVERIFIED]` tags were removed from section Markdown during the 2026-02-08 integrity remediation.
Claims that still require author substantiation are now tracked as `[AUTHOR-CHECK]` in the section files and `Claims` tab.

## Resolution Summary

- **Total [UNVERIFIED] claims resolved:** 44
- **Resolution methods (historical):**
  - Master Excel (S089, Figure 18): 11 claims
  - Market Reports (S104-S113): 12 claims
  - Industry Reports (S109-S112): 8 claims
  - Scientific Literature (S114): 1 claim
  - Corporate Filings (S115-S120): 3 claims
  - Internal Analysis (now reclassified to `[AUTHOR-CHECK]` where unsupported): 9 claims

## Data Mismatches Identified

Several claims showed significant discrepancies between text and Master Excel data:
- Mobility: Text $2.6B vs Data $776M
- Gut Health: Text $5.6B vs Data $2.9B
- Nutrigenomics: Text $3.5B vs Data $795M
- Sustainability: Text $3.35B vs Data $786M
- Performance: Text $7.1B vs Data $1.4B

These mismatches are now documented in the registry with proper source tags pointing to the actual data.
