# Unverified Claims Tracker

**STATUS: NO ACTIVE UNSOURCED CLAIMS (2026-02-08)**

All previously unresolved claims are now source-bound in the registry and section text.

## Current Unverified Scope

- **Total active `[UNVERIFIED]` claims in registry:** 0
- **Claim IDs:** `None`
- **Primary impacted sections:** `None`

## What Is Unverified (By Theme)

- No unresolved unsourced themes remain in the active report.

## Resolution Workflow

1. Open `_registry/source_registry.xlsx` → `Claims` tab.
2. Filter `source_ids = UNVERIFIED`.
3. Validate each claim against an in-repo primary source.
4. Replace `[UNVERIFIED]` in section text with `[Sxxx]` tags.
5. Update each claim row (`source_ids`, `source_location`, `verified`, `date_verified`, `notes`).
6. Update this tracker summary after each verification pass.
