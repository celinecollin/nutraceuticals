Subject: Prohibiting the Production, Sale and Use of Some Pharmaceutical Feed Additives
Effective Date: July 1, 2020 (Implementation completed by Dec 31, 2020)

Key Details:
- Banned the use of commercial feed containing growth-promoting drug feed additives (except traditional Chinese medicine).
- Targeted antibiotics including bacitracin zinc, flavomycin, virginiamycin.
- Logic: To reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and improve food safety.
- Market Impact: Accelerated shift toward "green" feed additives (probiotics, enzymes, phytogenics) and functional feeds.

This supports the "AGP Dividend" scenario where regulatory bans drive nutraceutical adoption.
