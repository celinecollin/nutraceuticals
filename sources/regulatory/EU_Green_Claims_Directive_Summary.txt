Title: Proposal for a Directive on Green Claims (2023/0085 COD)
Date: March 2023 (Proposal), March 2024 (Parliament adoption)

Key Provisions:
- Requires companies to substantiate voluntary green claims ("eco-friendly", "carbon neutral") with scientific evidence.
- Defines precise rules for communication and verification (pre-approval by third parties).
- "Green-washing" ban empowers consumers to seek redress.
- Institutionalizes the "Green Claim Stack" by requiring life-cycle assessment (LCA) data.

This supports the "Green-claim institutionalization" framework.
