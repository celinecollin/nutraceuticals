Key Findings:
- Urban pet owners are more likely to buy pet products online (63% vs 42% for suburban).
- Urban owners skew higher for anxiety/stress products (70% believe their pets have anxiety).
- Suburban owners are more price-sensitive and have higher rates of multi-pet households.
- Urban markets favor convenient, premium formats due to lifestyle and higher disposable income.

This supports the claim regarding "channel-demography coupling" where urban markets skew toward easier formats and specific health bundles.
