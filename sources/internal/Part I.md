Definition, Scope and Structural Dynamics


I.1. Terminology


The term nutraceutical is a fusion of "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical," coined in 1989 to describe food or food derivatives that provide health benefits, such as the prevention or treatment of disease, beyond basic nutrition. This common terminology is central to the market but lacks a harmonized legal definition, forcing many products into a regulatory "grey area between pharmaceuticals and food. In the context of intensive farming, most health-focused products fall under the rigorous regulation applied to feed additives, defined as substances intentionally incorporated into animal feed or water to improve its quality, enhance animal health and performance, or improve the quality of food derived from animals. The European Union (EU) provides a strict framework (Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003), classifying functional ingredients into specific categories, including zootechnical additives, which offer performance-enhancing, non-nutritive benefits like promoting gut flora stability or increasing digestibility. In contrast, the United States typically forces these products into a binary choice between "food" (if Generally Recognized As Safe or GRAS) or a fully regulated "new animal drug" (if therapeutic claims are made). This intense regulatory friction has spurred recent US legislative attempts, such as the proposed Innovative FEED Act (H.R. 2203/S. 1906), aiming to create a clearer pathway for "zootechnical animal food substances" to gain market approval as food additives rather than facing the long and costly drug application process. This fundamental international divergence in classification and required scientific evidence establishes a highly complex environment for manufacturers, necessitating a detailed review of the Regulatory Landscape by Region.







I.2. Regulatory Landscape by Region 

I.2.1. United States (US)

I.2.1.1. Nutraceuticals 

No formal regulatory category for "veterinary nutraceuticals": Unlike the human sector, where the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 created a distinct legal class for supplements, the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has explicitly determined that DSHEA does not apply to animal products. Consequently, there is no legal definition for "veterinary nutraceuticals." Products are classified strictly as either "animal food" (feed) or "new animal drugs" based on their intended use. This binary framework forces manufacturers to market supplements as "food" to avoid the prohibitive costs and multi-year timelines associated with the New Animal Drug Application (NADA) process required for pharmaceutical approval.



Companion animal supplements fall under FDA-CVM and AAFCO guidelines: Historically, the FDA-CVM and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) operated under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to harmonize ingredient approvals. However, this partnership dissolved on October 1, 2024, creating a fractured regulatory environment.



Federal Review (FDA): The FDA now independently reviews new ingredients through the Animal Food Ingredient Consultation (AFIC) process (GFI #294). Successful review results in a "Consultation Complete" letter, granting federal enforcement discretion.



State Review (AAFCO): In parallel, AAFCO has launched the Scientific Review of Ingredient Submissions (SRIS) pathway, managed by Kansas State University, to vet ingredients for inclusion in the AAFCO Official Publication, which is legally adopted by most states.



Note: The "PURR Act of 2025" (H.R. 597) has been introduced in Congress to potentially centralize this authority solely under the FDA, though it faces opposition from state regulators.



I.2.1.2. Feed additives 



Products marketed as feed additives must use approved ingredients; therapeutic claims trigger drug classification: To remain compliant as "food," products must strictly adhere to ingredient and labeling standards:

Ingredients: Manufacturers must use ingredients that are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS), approved food additives, or listed in the 2024 AAFCO Official Publication (protected under FDA GFI #293 enforcement discretion). AAFCO also maintains a "Common Food Index" for standard items like vegetables to clarify their status without full definition.

Labeling Claims: Marketing is restricted to "structure/function" claims (e.g., "supports joint health"). Any claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease ("treats arthritis" for example) classifies the product as an unapproved new animal drug, rendering it adulterated under the FD&C Act.



I.2.1.3. Food supplements 



NASC (National Animal Supplement Council) labeling is a voluntary standard used in pet supplements: Given the lack of a formal "supplement" category, the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) fills the regulatory void through rigorous self-regulation.

Quality Seal: To display the NASC Quality Seal, companies must pass third-party facility audits ensuring compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) under FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act).

Adverse Event Reporting: Members are required to participate in the NASC Adverse Event Reporting System (NAERS), sharing post-market safety data with the FDA-CVM to demonstrate product safety and transparency. This voluntary compliance is widely viewed by the industry as a "shield" against enforcement action for products operating in the regulatory grey area.



I.2.2. European Union (EU)

I.2.2.1. A Strict Binary System: The Absence of a "Nutraceutical" Status



The European Union operates under a rigid legal framework that does not recognize the term "nutraceutical." A product is classified strictly as either a Feed (subject to feed law) or a Veterinary Medicinal Product (subject to drug law). There is no "middle ground" legal category like dietary supplements for humans.





I.2.2.2. Feed Materials vs. Feed Additives: A crucial didactic distinction exists within the "Feed" category.



Feed Materials: Natural ingredients used for nutrition (e.g., glucosamine, chondroitin sulphate, yeast) are regulated under Regulation (EC) No 767/2009. They generally do not require pre-market authorization, provided they are safe and listed in the EU Catalogue of Feed Materials (Regulation (EU) No 68/2013).

Feed Additives: Substances added for a specific technological, sensory, or nutritional function (e.g., pure vitamins, preservatives, trace elements) are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. These require a rigorous, expensive pre-market authorization and must be explicitly listed in the Community Register of Feed Additives.





I.2.2.3. Zootechnical Additives



The "Performance" Category Unlike the US, the EU has established a specific, highly regulated category for ingredients that affect animal physiology: Zootechnical Additives (Category 4 under Reg. 1831/2003). This includes gut flora stabilizers (probiotics) and digestibility enhancers (enzymes).



Efficacy Requirement: To obtain this classification, manufacturers must submit a dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) proving not only safety but also efficacy. They must demonstrate valid scientific evidence that the additive significantly improves the animal's performance or welfare. This provides a legal route for performance claims that would otherwise be considered "medicinal."





I.2.2.4. Claims Landscape: The Prohibition of Medicinal Claims and the "PARNUTs" Exception



The marketing of supplements is defined by a strict "Negative Scope": feed cannot claim to treat, prevent, or cure disease. Making such a claim reclassifies the product as a Veterinary Medicinal Product (VMP) by presentation, triggering the heavy compliance burden of Regulation (EU) 2019/6.



Functional Claims: Products may make "functional" claims (e.g., "Supports joint health") if they are substantiated by science, as outlined in the FEDIAF Code of Good Labelling Practice.



The PARNUTs Exception: The only legal exception allowing diet-disease linkage is for Feeds for Particular Nutritional Purposes (PARNUTs), regulated under Regulation (EU) 2020/354. This regulation provides a "positive list" of permitted dietetic claims for specific conditions ("Support of renal function in cases of chronic renal insufficiency" for example). If a condition is not on this list, no disease-related claim can be made.





I.2.2.5. Focus on Safety and Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 



Under the "Farm to Fork" strategy, the authorization of additives requires a comprehensive Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA).



The Phase I/II System: EFSA employs a tiered approach. If the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) of an additive in soil or water exceeds specific trigger values (e.g., 10 ¬µg/kg in soil), the applicant must conduct Phase II ecotoxicity studies on non-target organisms (e.g., earthworms, algae, fish). This is particularly critical for additives used in aquaculture or intensive livestock farming, where environmental accumulation is a key regulatory concern.



Quality Standards: To ensure traceability and safety across the supply chain, operators often adhere to third-party certification schemes like FAMI-QS (for additives) or GMP+, which enforce standards often exceeding statutory requirements.









I.2.3. United Kingdom (UK)



I.2.3.1. Post-Brexit Regulatory Autonomy



Following its withdrawal from the European Union, the UK has repatriated full regulatory sovereignty, transitioning from EU-dependent structures to independent national oversight. While the legal foundation remains "Assimilated Law" (formerly Retained EU Law) derived from EU regulations, the UK has begun to actively diverge to suit domestic needs. This new framework is primarily governed by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMR) 2013, which were comprehensively modernized by the Veterinary Medicines (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2024.



The Dual Authority Structure: Responsibility is strictly divided. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) oversees veterinary medicines and the "borderline" with supplements, while the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) regulate feed additives and feed safety.

The Windsor Framework Challenge: A unique complexity exists regarding Northern Ireland (NI). Under the Windsor Framework, NI remains subject to EU veterinary medicine laws (Regulation (EU) 2019/6) to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. This creates a "dual regime" where manufacturers must navigate UK rules for Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) and EU rules for Northern Ireland, complicating supply chains for companies operating UK-wide.







I.2.3.2. The VMD and the Strict "Medicine vs. Feed" Boundary 



Similar to the EU and US, the VMD does not recognize the term "nutraceutical" as a legal category. A product is classified strictly based on its presentation and function, as detailed in the VMD's Guidance Note 14.



Medicinal Claims: Any product presented as treating, preventing, or curing a disease, or which modifies physiological function through pharmacological action, is classified as a Veterinary Medicinal Product (VMP). Marketing such a product without a Marketing Authorization (MA) is a criminal offense.

The Small Animal Exemption Scheme (SAES): A distinct and commercially vital feature of the UK landscape is the SAES (Schedule 6 of the VMR). This scheme allows for the marketing of certain medicines for "minor" pet species (such as aquarium fish, cage birds, and small rodents—but notably not dogs or cats) without the prohibitive cost of a full Marketing Authorization, provided they meet strict safety and labeling criteria.





I.2.3.3. Feed Additives and Supplements: FSA Conformity and the 2025 Reforms 



Functional ingredients that are not medicines fall under the jurisdiction of the FSA/FSS. Post-Brexit, the UK replaced the EFSA authorization route with its own Regulated Products Application Service.



Accelerated Approvals (April 2025 Reform): In a major move to signal "Brexit dividends," the UK government implemented significant reforms in April 2025. Most notably, the FSA abolished the requirement for 10-year renewals of feed additive authorizations. The UK regulator deemed this EU-inherited process to be administratively burdensome with little safety benefit. By removing this hurdle, the FSA aims to free up regulatory capacity to assess new innovative ingredients faster, potentially making the UK a more agile market for novel feed technologies than the EU.



I.2.3.4. Future Outlook: An Independent Path for Innovation 



The UK is positioning itself as a testbed for regulatory innovation. The 2024 VMR amendments introduced some of the world's strictest controls on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including mandatory data reporting on antibiotic usage. Simultaneously, the streamlined authorization process for feed additives allows approvals to be granted by Ministerial decision and published directly in a register, bypassing the lengthy legislative voting process required in Brussels. Manufacturers targeting the UK must now build a strategy that leverages these streamlined pathways for Great Britain while managing the separate compliance requirements for Northern Ireland.







I.3. Scope of Analysis



This report examines the veterinary nutraceutical landscape through the dual lens of physiological function and regulatory status. As definitions remain blurred between supplements, functional feeds, and drugs, establishing clear analytical boundaries is essential to avoid semantic and commercial ambiguity.



I.3.1. What Is Included

The analysis focuses on functional bioactive compounds that go beyond basic nutritional support, aiming to modulate physiological processes related to joint health, gut function, immune resilience, cognition, and behavioral balance. These products are typically integrated into delivery systems tailored to species-specific compliance and bioavailability constraints.



I.3.1.1. Delivery Systems Across Species

Companion animals (palatability-driven): In dogs and cats, product success often hinges on owner compliance. According to 2023 consumer research, only ~15% of pet owners prefer tablets, while soft chews account for nearly 59% of preferred supplement formats due to their treat-like appeal (Kerwin, 2024; Mordor Intelligence, 2024). Other viable formats include powders (for dosage flexibility), liquids, and functional gels.

Livestock and aquaculture (efficiency-driven): In production animals, delivery formats are engineered for integration into industrial feed or water systems. These include:

Premixes, typically incorporated at 0.5–4% inclusion rates, enabling uniform distribution of concentrated actives (Making.com, 2023).

Microencapsulation, used especially in ruminants, protects sensitive compounds (e.g., amino acids, enzymes) from ruminal degradation, ensuring targeted intestinal release (Sahraei Belverdy et al., 2019).

Water-soluble powders, deployed during stress phases (e.g., heat stress or weaning), when feed intake drops but water consumption persists (Durvet, 2021).

Boluses, high-density tablets retained in the reticulorumen, allowing slow release over weeks or months — commonly used for minerals and long-acting actives in cattle (León-Cruz & Ramírez-Bribiesca, 2020).



I.3.1.2. Functional Targets Over General Nutrition



This report prioritizes ingredients with a defined therapeutic or physiological objective, such as modulating inflammation, microbiota composition, neurotransmission, or oxidative stress. These products differ from basic feed additives or multivitamins by their mechanistic specificity, evidence-backed functionality, and regulatory sensitivity.

While precise ingredient analysis is provided in later sections, categories include bioactives targeting:

Joint and mobility support

Gut health and feed conversion

Anxiety and cognitive aging

Immune system priming in production settings





I.3.2. What Is Excluded



To maintain analytical precision, the following categories are out of scope — though they may influence adjacent market dynamics:

Prescription veterinary pharmaceuticals, such as NSAIDs or antimicrobials, which are regulated separately as New Animal Drugs (FDA) or VMPs (EU/UK)

Agricultural commodities (corn, soybean meal, etc.) used for bulk caloric or protein input, unless functionally enhanced

General multivitamin blends without a clearly defined health indication (e.g. “insurance” formulations for micronutrient adequacy)

Human dietary supplements, which are not legally recognized under veterinary frameworks like DSHEA (1994) and often contain ingredients toxic to animals — e.g. xylitol or excessive vitamin D (FDA, 2021; AVMA, 2019)
