II. Functional Segmentation, Use Cases, Drug-Sparing Logic, and Clinical Validation



II.1. Mobility and Joint Health (Dogs, Cats, Horses)



A. Drug-sparing target (what it competes with)

Primary medicines the nutraceutical stack tries to reduce or delay:

NSAIDs (dogs/cats: eg, carprofen, meloxicam; horses: phenylbutazone, flunixin, firocoxib) due to GI, renal, and hepatic risk with chronic use.

Newer OA therapeutics (eg, anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies in pets) are high-efficacy but higher-cost, so “delay escalation” can be a strong economic claim when supported.

Intra-articular therapies (mostly equine): hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, regenerative products.

This is a classic “chronic condition” segment: it supports subscription-like purchasing and premium formats (chews, liquids) when clinical credibility is strong.

B. Ingredients with the strongest veterinary evidence

Omega-3 (EPA/DHA, fish oil)

Evidence: controlled clinical work in dogs shows improved functional outcomes such as weight-bearing in OA when fed EPA/DHA-enriched diets/supplementation (Roush et al. 2010). A systematic review across horses/dogs/cats found overall evidence weak for most nutraceuticals, with omega-3 in dogs being the clearest exception (Vandeweerd et al. 2012).

Green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus)

Evidence: controlled work indicates improvements in pain/mobility proxies; one controlled evaluation concluded GLM alleviated chronic orthopedic pain in dogs but was less effective than carprofen, positioning GLM as an option when NSAIDs cannot be used (Hielm-Björkman et al. 2009). A diet-enrichment study also reports improvements in pain/function measures over time (Rialland et al. 2012).

Eggshell membrane (and “composite” joint chews)

Evidence: a multicenter double-blind RCT in dogs with OA reported improvement on validated owner questionnaires and between-group differences on pain interference; the paper explicitly relates to Movoflex (Ragetly et al. 2025). This supports positioning as a clinically documented joint product rather than generic glucosamine.

C. Ingredients with mixed or emerging evidence (still commercially important)

Undenatured type II collagen (UC-II), often combined

Evidence: RCT data exist; for example a randomized double-blind cross-over study reported improvements on owner mobility scoring with a UC-II plus Boswellia chew versus placebo (Stabile et al. 2024). However, broader OA meta-analyses have rated collagen-based categories as among the weaker positives relative to omega-3 (Barbeau-Grégoire et al. 2022).

Boswellia / curcumin (turmeric)

Evidence: there are controlled studies in dogs, including trials of curcumin plus Boswellia-type combinations that report improvements in OA metrics, but study sizes and heterogeneity often keep this in “promising but not definitive” territory (eg, Caterino et al. 2021).

Oral hyaluronic acid

Evidence exists but is typically narrower (biomarkers, short trials, variable endpoints). It is best positioned as part of a multi-ingredient mobility SKU rather than a single-claim cornerstone unless strong clinical endpoints are shown (Aguado et al. 2021).

Glucosamine + chondroitin

Evidence: systematic evaluation in pets has questioned meaningful efficacy for OA pain and function; a 2022 systematic review/meta-analysis reported a marked non-effect for chondroitin-glucosamine categories, explicitly recommending they should no longer be recommended for OA pain management in dogs/cats (Barbeau-Grégoire et al. 2022). This is crucial for investment: it drives commoditization risk and increases the value of better-evidenced alternatives.

Commercial notes (why this segment monetizes)

Strong willingness to pay: owners perceive mobility as “quality of life.”

Best products behave like maintenance subscriptions (monthly chews).

The moat is clinical substantiation + brand trust, not raw ingredient novelty.



II.2. Gut Health and Microbiome Modulation (Livestock, Aquaculture, Dogs, Cats)

A. Drug-sparing target

Companion animals

Commonly competes with or aims to reduce use of antibiotics frequently prescribed for acute diarrhea (eg, metronidazole), plus symptomatic drugs.

Production animals and aquaculture

Competes with or replaces part of the function of:

Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in jurisdictions where banned or pressured.

Metaphylactic antibiotics and “routine” antimicrobial use.

In pigs, also overlaps with post-weaning diarrhea strategies historically supported by pharmaceutical ZnO, which has been withdrawn in the EU context (EMA referral).

EU context: AGPs have been withdrawn since January 1, 2006, which structurally increased demand for non-antibiotic performance and gut-health tools (Castanon 2007).
US context: veterinary oversight and label changes for medically important antimicrobials in feed have also tightened incentives toward alternatives (FDA VFD overview).

B. Ingredients with strong or investable evidence

Probiotics (species and strain dependent)

Dogs: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial compared a multi-strain probiotic, metronidazole, and placebo in acute diarrhea and supports the idea that well-selected probiotics can be credible alternatives in uncomplicated cases (Shmalberg et al. 2019).

Weaned pigs: meta-analysis evidence supports probiotics improving growth performance and feed efficiency metrics, depending on context and strain (Zimmermann et al. 2016).

Prebiotics (MOS/FOS; “gut architecture” economics)

Broilers: a meta-analysis reported performance effects for mannan-oligosaccharides in broilers, supporting MOS as a production-relevant gut additive category (Hooge 2004).

Synbiotics

Dogs: controlled work in shelter settings found synbiotic administration reduced diarrhea incidence, which is directly monetizable via reduced morbidity and reputational risk in high-density environments (Rose et al. 2017).

Postbiotics and butyrate donors (eg, tributyrin)

Piglets: controlled studies on tributyrin supplementation report improvements in intestinal morphology and growth-related outcomes, supporting post-weaning gut resilience positioning (Chen et al. 2023).

Organic acids (feed hygiene and gut pH economics)

The evidence base is broad and typically framed around antimicrobial effects in the gut and performance, with results depending on matrix and dose. Reviews summarize the role of organic acids as alternatives supportive of performance and gut health in pigs and poultry (Nguyen and Kim 2020).

Clay binders and toxin adsorbents

These are typically justified by mycotoxin risk management; reviews summarize clay minerals as binders/adsorbents in animal production with performance and health implications, but quality varies by binder and toxin spectrum (Döll and Dänicke 2011; more recent syntheses exist).

Commercial notes

In livestock/aquaculture, gut-health products are often sold B2B with ROI logic (FCR, mortality, antibiotic spend).

The moat is often process + application know-how (stability, delivery, premix integration), not only the active ingredient.









II.3. Immunity and Resilience (Aquaculture, Poultry, Swine; plus neonatal mammals)

A. Drug-sparing target

Reduces infectious pressure and therefore antibiotic need or loss events, rather than replacing a single drug.

Often positioned around “stress windows” (weaning, transfer, vaccination, heat stress).

B. Evidence-backed ingredient families

Beta-1,3/1,6-glucans (yeast derivatives)

Aquaculture: reviews describe immunomodulatory and disease resistance roles of beta-glucans in fish, supporting the “resilience” claim set (Meena et al. 2013).

Spray-dried plasma / immunoglobulin-rich fractions

Piglets: reviews summarize use in early life to support performance and gut integrity; often used as part of post-weaning strategies where antimicrobial pressure is high (Torrallardona 2010).

Seaweed and polysaccharides

Controlled feeding trials exist in ruminants and other species with variable endpoints (immunity, oxidative stress, productivity). For example, supplementation research exists in dairy cows focusing on metabolic and immune-related outcomes (Sweeney et al. 2022).

Nucleotides (often yeast-derived)

Poultry: controlled supplementation studies report changes in growth and immune response parameters, supporting immune-resilience positioning (Abdel-Moneim et al. 2020).

Commercial notes

Most “immunity” claims are easiest to monetize in production species via measurable endpoints (mortality, ADG, uniformity), but require careful study design to avoid over-claiming.



II.4. Cognitive Support and Healthy Aging (Senior Dogs and Cats)

A. Drug-sparing target

Adjuncts to, or delay of, pharmacologic management of cognitive dysfunction (eg, selegiline in dogs) and mitigation of comorbid anxiety or sleep disturbances.

B. Evidence-backed levers

Antioxidant-enriched diets

A controlled study in aged dogs reported improved learning performance with an antioxidant-enriched diet (Cotman et al. 2002).

MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides)

Controlled work in aged dogs reported cognitive benefits when diets were enriched with MCTs (Pan et al. 2010). PubMed

Where the evidence is heading

A systematic review of enriched diets and nutraceuticals for cognitive function in aged dogs/cats summarizes the clinical trial landscape and highlights that enriched diets often have higher methodological quality than supplements, while several supplement categories remain promising but heterogeneous (Mellier et al. 2025).

Commercial notes

Monetization often occurs via premium “senior” functional diets and clinically positioned supplement bundles.

The moat is validated endpoints and compliance (palatable formats).



II.5. Calming and Behavioral Wellness (Dogs, Cats, Horses)

A. Drug-sparing target

Aims to reduce reliance on: benzodiazepines, trazodone, SSRIs/clomipramine, alpha-2 agonists, and situational sedatives.

Most credible positioning is: mild to moderate anxiety, situational stress (noise, travel), and behavior plans where owners prefer “natural-first.”

B. Evidence-backed ingredients

Alpha-casozepine (milk protein derivative)

Controlled diet-based work suggests benefit in stress/anxiety contexts (Palestrini et al. 2010). Evidence syntheses in veterinary evidence databases often classify effects as modest and context-dependent. ScienceDirect+1

L-theanine

Clinical evidence exists in dogs for stress-related outcomes in controlled settings (Pike et al. 2015).

Tryptophan

Evidence is mixed and often confounded by diet context and behavioral heterogeneity; it is typically positioned as supportive rather than primary.

CBD (hemp derivatives)

Evidence is developing but regulatory constraints remain material. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated clinical applications and emphasize heterogeneity in product standardization and dose-response (Brioschi et al. 2023).

Commercial notes

This segment is often DTC-led and marketing-sensitive, which increases upside but also regulatory and reputational downside if claims outrun evidence.



II.6. Performance, FCR, and Growth (Livestock and Aquaculture; some equine sport use)

A. Drug-sparing target

Primary “replacement” target is the function historically provided by AGPs and high routine antimicrobial use.

Also competes with higher-cost nutritional strategies by offering measurable ROI through FCR and yield.

B. Evidence-backed ingredient families (production economics first)

Enzymes (phytase, xylanase, multi-enzyme complexes)

Phytase: a foundational feed technology for phosphorus utilization; reviews cover its effects on nutrient availability and environmental outputs (Selle and Ravindran 2007).

Xylanase and carbohydrases: reviews describe performance mechanisms and outcomes across monogastrics (Kiarie et al. 2013).

Phytogenics (essential oils and plant extracts)

Reviews summarize phytogenic feed additives as AGP alternatives with variable results by composition and context (Murugesan et al. 2015; Abdelli et al. 2021). Frontiers

Yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

Dairy: meta-analysis of RCTs reports increases in milk production outcomes, supporting a high-confidence ROI narrative for certain yeast culture products (Poppy et al. 2012).

Trace minerals (chelated forms)

Evidence exists but is highly context-specific (baseline deficiency, antagonists, formulation). Investability often comes from proprietary chelation technologies and field ROI proof.

Commercial notes

This is typically a B2B, premix-driven segment where defensibility comes from:

IP (strain, encapsulation, enzyme engineering)

Application data (field trials)

Integration into premix/feed mill workflows

Safety and reputational risk is non-trivial in pets:

Garlic (Allium spp.) is widely marketed online as a “natural repellent”, but veterinary references warn of oxidative damage and Heinz body anemia risk in dogs and cats at sufficient exposure (Merck Veterinary Manual; PDSA). 

Investor takeaway: the “nutraceutical angle” in ectoparasites is most defensible as:

skin/coat support adjuncts,

environmental or integrated pest management tools, or

regulated actives presented in “friendlier” delivery or brand wrappers.
Trying to position these as a direct replacement for regulated parasiticides generally increases regulatory and litigation risk.

II.8. Ectoparasite Control and Vector-Borne Risk Management

In most markets, true flea/tick or fly control is regulated as a pesticide or a drug, so “nutraceutical” products tend to sit in an adjunct space rather than a direct substitute.



II.8.1. Livestock: “feed-through” fly control is industrial and claims-based

In cattle operations, there is an established category of feed-through fly control where the active passes through the animal and acts in manure to disrupt larval development. Importantly, labels typically state it is not effective against existing adult flies and must be used as part of a broader integrated program (ClariFly label; Altosid IGR technical and label documents).

Diflubenzuron feed-through programs are positioned to prevent fly development in manure rather than kill adults (ClariFly labels).

S-methoprene feed-through is positioned as an insect growth regulator and described as passing into manure where flies lay eggs (Altosid IGR documents).

Horn fly burden is frequently described as a material productivity cost in beef systems; some industry materials cite very large aggregate impacts (Altosid IGR XRB FAQ).



II.8.2. Companion animals: “natural repellents” exist, but evidence and safety are uneven

Botanical actives (notably certain essential oils) show insecticidal/repellent activity in laboratory 

Figures for II.8

Risk matrix for “natural ectoparasite” products: efficacy uncertainty vs safety risk vs regulatory risk (with examples like essential oils and garlic).



II.9. Nutrigenomics and Systemic Disease Prevention

Nutrigenomics is not a product category by itself. It is a product development and differentiation logic: using gene-expression, pathway biomarkers, and omics readouts to support claims such as resilience, gut integrity, immune responsiveness, and metabolic efficiency.

II.9.1. Why nutrigenomics shows up in animal nutrition investment theses

Nutrigenomics is increasingly used to:

identify plausible mechanisms (for example oxidative stress pathways like Nrf2),

stratify animals by response

build a more “pharma-like” evidence narrative for nutrition products (Deon et al., 2025; review literature on Nrf2 modulation by polyphenols such as curcumin).

Nutrigenomics aims to:

support premium pricing through stronger substantiation, and

create defensibility (data packages, proprietary biomarkers, formulation know-how), even when ingredients are not patent-protected.

II.9.2. Livestock and aquaculture: gut integrity and immune function as “antibiotic-alternative infrastructure”

A large portion of functional nutrition innovation in production animals targets the gut as the “control point” for performance and resilience:

MOS (mannan oligosaccharides) are widely discussed as prebiotics that can influence microbiota, pathogen interactions, and immune response across species (Sharma, 2024; Kiarie et al., 2012).

Butyrate and butyrate-releasing strategies are supported by mechanistic and animal evidence linked to barrier function and tight-junction biology; piglet work frequently anchors the practical narrative around weaning stress (Zeng et al., 2015).

In aquaculture, immune-support strategies often dominate because many species rely heavily on innate immunity, and vaccination is not broadly practical for some groups (notably shrimp) in the same way it is for terrestrial livestock (Hauton, 2021). 
Beta-glucans are among the most frequently studied immunostimulants in fish and shrimp contexts (Meena et al., 2013).



II.9.3. Interaction with vaccination and health programs

Some feed-derived compounds (including saponins and yeast-derived immunomodulators) are discussed as adjuvant-like tools that can modulate immune response and antibody readouts, but effect sizes depend on antigen, species, and baseline nutrition. Evidence exists in poultry and other species, but the most credible positioning is supportive rather than deterministic (Chen et al., 2021; Meena et al., 2013).

Gut health value bridge: microbiome modulation → barrier integrity → inflammation load → performance and medication outcomes (species-specific callouts: broilers, weaned piglets, fish).

Nutrigenomics workflow: ingredient → biomarker panel → responder segmentation → claim substantiation.



II.10. Advanced Formulations and Delivery Systems

Delivery format is not packaging. It is often the difference between a commodity ingredient and a scalable, defensible product with better compliance, stability, and repeat purchase.

II.10.1. Companion animals: compliance and repeat purchase economics

For dogs and cats, product-market fit is heavily driven by:

palatability (treat-like formats),

dosing convenience

brand trust.

This is why “chew” formats and flavored delivery systems are so widespread in pet supplements, even when the underlying bioactives are similar across brands. Market sizing sources differ on the exact split by format, but the direction is consistent: treat-like formats are a dominant innovation pathway in pet supplements.

II.10.2. Production animals: protection, targeting, and industrial compatibility

In livestock, advanced delivery systems often exist to solve one of three problems:

stability during processing,

survival through harsh digestive environments,

release at a specific site (for example hindgut delivery).

Evidence and reviews highlight microencapsulation as a key enabling technology to protect actives and improve delivery reliability (Almassri et al., 2024; Fontana et al., 2025).
Empirical studies in poultry also evaluate microencapsulated phytogenics (for example cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol) for performance and gut-related outcomes (Bosetti et al., 2020).

For ruminants, rumen-protection technologies (often lipid matrices) are central to delivering amino acids and other actives past the rumen; this is a mature and still-evolving area with both academic and applied literature (Inô et al., 2024; Fleming et al., 2019).

Controlled-release boluses represent another industrial delivery approach for minerals and monitoring, with studies assessing their performance as nutrient delivery systems (Carlisle et al., 2021).

“Value of formulation” chart: same active ingredient, different realized efficacy/compliance and margin (conceptual).



II.11. Sustainability and the “Green Claim” Economy

Sustainability is moving from marketing to procurement logic in livestock and aquaculture, particularly where large buyers track Scope 3 emissions and nutrient footprints.

 https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/what-are-scope-1-2-3-carbon-emissions



II.11.1. Methane mitigation in ruminants: from biology to carbon economics

Enteric fermentation is a major methane source, and the livestock share of methane is explicitly treated in climate assessments (IPCC, 2021).

Two high-profile solution families illustrate how “nutraceutical-like” additives can become compliance tools:

Asparagopsis (red seaweed): controlled feeding trials report large methane reductions under certain inclusion rates and diet contexts (Roque et al., 2021).

3-NOP (3-nitrooxypropanol): peer-reviewed work and meta-analyses commonly report methane reductions around the high-20% range, with ongoing attention on economics and who pays (Hristov et al., 2015; Pupo et al., 2025).

Recent regulatory momentum has also been visible in the US context for methane-reducing additives (Reuters, 2024).

II.11.2. Nutrient excretion: phosphorus and nitrogen as measurable externalities

For monogastrics, enzymes such as phytase are among the most established “sustainability and efficiency” tools because they can improve phosphorus utilization and reduce excretion, with effects supported by meta-analysis evidence in poultry (Afsharmanesh et al., 2023).

For nitrogen, strategies include better amino acid balance and protease use to improve protein utilization; meta-analyses in broilers evaluate protease effects on digestibility and performance outcomes, which is the operational route to lower nitrogen waste (Cowieson et al., 2020).

A related operational linkage is litter quality: high moisture and ammonia are repeatedly cited as drivers of footpad dermatitis risk, making “gut efficiency” interventions potentially relevant beyond pure growth metrics (Shepherd and Fairchild, 2010).

II.11.3. Omega-3 supply chain resilience: algae and fermentation as strategic inputs

Fish oil markets are exposed to marine supply volatility; microalgae (for example Schizochytrium) are frequently discussed as scalable DHA sources for aquaculture and, increasingly, other animal applications (Shah et al., 2023).

Sustainability-linked additives are increasingly evaluated through a three-part lens:

biological efficacy,

auditability (measurable reductions),

economics (premium, incentives, or carbon payments).
