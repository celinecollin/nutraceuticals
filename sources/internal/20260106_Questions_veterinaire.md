Veterinary Expert Interview: Animal Nutraceuticals



General questions



How, in your perspective, have nutraceuticals changed the care of pets and livestock? 

Beyond pet humanization and yield/quality (organic etc…) meat concerns, do nutraceuticals have a perennial place in animal care? 

We understood that there were 3 major players: raw material extractors (eg. krill oil extraction), manufacturer that formulate premixes and/or soft chews etc … and pet food companies that incorporate those premixes in the food. Could you help us clarify who we should talk to? Any trendy brands/companies? 

Which companies do you personally see as the most reliable when it comes to clinical data and solid evidence behind their products?





Clinical practice and positioning

Where do nutraceuticals sit in your standard of care today (prevention, adjunct to drugs, or first-line in mild cases)?

- Examples of conditions where they add the most value (joint, GI, skin, stress, etc.).

- What outcome do you expect and in what timeframe?

- 

Are there any nutraceuticals you've stopped recommending after initial optimism, and why?



Which nutraceutical products or brands do you recommend most often?

- For each: target species, indication, and why you trust it (results, quality, palatability, price).

How are nutraceuticals typically obtained and given?

- Veterinary recommendation/sale vs owner self-purchase (online, retail). Rough split? 

- Do you stock them, or do you just point owners to what you trust?

- Which formats give the best adherence (chews, capsules, powder, liquid, in-feed)?



Selection criteria, evidence, and quality

What drives your product choice the most: clinical evidence, bioavailability/PK, manufacturing quality/testing, label transparency, palatability, or price?

- How do you distinguish a serious product from marketing? 

- Have you ever been burned by a product that looked legit but flopped?

- Are there strong clinical evidence and could you recommend reviews/articles?

- Any quality standards or certifications you look for?

- What's your take on studies funded by the manufacturer vs. independent research?

- 

- 

- Safety and misuse

Have you had to manage owner expectations when a product didn't work as advertised?

Have you seen adverse events, toxicity, or drug-nutrient interactions linked to nutraceuticals?

- What are the most common issues and how do you mitigate them?

- Are OTC and online products a higher-risk category in your experience?

CBD and cannabinoids: do you use or recommend them? Would you classify them as nutraceuticals per se ?

- If yes: main indications and your dosing/safety approach.

- If no: main blocker (evidence, regulation, product variability).

- 

What's your honest take on the CBD gold rush? Do you think the evidence will catch up to the hype, or the reverse?





Economics, channels, and production animals



Pricing and adherence: at what monthly price does long-term compliance drop?

- Companion animals: typical monthly budget or price ceiling.

- Production animals: how do producers assess ROI (performance, health, reduced treatments)?

Production animals: since AGP and ZnO restrictions, which nutraceutical families show the clearest field impact?

- Probiotics, organic acids, enzymes, yeast derivatives, phytogenics, postbiotics: what works, what does not?

- Do you see real antibiotic reduction? Which antibiotic use cases could realistically be reduced?

How has e-commerce/direct-to-consumer sourcing changed your role?

- More risk (quality control, adherence) or more access? Do you maintain a shortlist of trusted options?

Are there price-point tiers? Like, do $50/month supplements fail faster than $150/month?

Post-AGP, are you seeing producers replace antibiotics with nutraceuticals, or just both because they're uncertain?



Regulation and outlook

What do regulators misunderstand about how you use these products?

Are there ingredients or products you'd like to see pulled from the market?

If you could change the rules around veterinary nutraceuticals, what changes would most increase product quality and make you (and owners) trust them more?



Minimum quality standards, proof of content, limits on claims, adverse event reporting, contamination controls.

Should rules differ between companion supplements and production feed additives?



Looking ahead 3 to 5 years, what is the biggest opportunity and the biggest risk in veterinary nutraceuticals? 

- One concrete recommendation for manufacturers developing products in this space.

- Regulation that could put nutraceuticals in danger ?
