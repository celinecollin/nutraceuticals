# II. Functional Segmentation, Use Cases, Drug-Sparing Logic, and Clinical Validation NEW VERSION.docx

II. Functional Segmentation, Use Cases, Drug-Sparing Logic, and Clinical Validation

Figure II.1. Market segmentation map, “Functional intent” by species and use case

Purpose (why this figure exists):
Give the reader a one-page view of what nutraceuticals do in animals, and how the same functional claim means different things commercially depending on species and production context.

Visual concept (what it looks like):
A matrix with:

Rows: the six functional areas (Mobility, Gut, Immunity, Cognitive aging, Calming, Performance/FCR)

Columns: species clusters (Dogs/Cats, Horses, Swine, Poultry, Ruminants, Aquaculture)

Each cell contains:

Primary use case(s) (1–2 words, eg “OA pain support”, “weaning diarrhea”, “heat stress”, “survival under handling”)

Dominant format (chews/oils vs premix/feed-integrated vs water soluble)

What “success” is measured by (CBPI/locomotion for pets, lameness scoring for horses, FCR/ADG/mortality for production)

How to build (data inputs):
No external numbers are required. This is a structured synthesis figure, based on your segmentation.

How to read (financial message):
It shows where products behave like:

B2C chronic recurring spend (pets, mobility/calm/cognitive)

B2B ROI tools (livestock/aquaculture, gut/performance/immunity)

Hybrid markets (horses, where premium + performance coexist)



II.1. Mobility and Joint Health (Dogs, Cats, Horses)

Figure II.2. The “drug-sparing ladder”, from nutraceuticals to prescription therapy

Purpose:
Make the nuance explicit: nutraceuticals rarely “replace” drugs in moderate/severe disease, but they can be first-line in mild cases or adjuncts that reduce escalation and chronic exposure.

Visual concept:
Two side-by-side therapy ladders (one for Pets, one for Livestock/Aquaculture).

Panel A: Pets (OA example)

Ladder levels (bottom to top):

Nutraceuticals and functional diets (EPA/DHA, eggshell membrane complexes, UC-II stacks, weight management)

Symptomatic non-Rx and multimodal support (physio, environment, exercise modulation)

Prescription analgesia and anti-inflammatory control (NSAIDs, newer OA therapies)

Advanced interventions (specialist care, injectables, surgery where relevant)

Add a callout arrow:
“Drug-sparing zone: reduces symptom burden and may reduce NSAID exposure in chronic pathways (adjunct positioning).”

Panel B: Livestock/Aquaculture (gut/performance example)

Ladder levels:

Biosecurity + nutrition baseline

Functional additives (enzymes, probiotics, organic acids, postbiotics, phytogenics)

Targeted therapeutic interventions under vet oversight (antimicrobials where needed)

Crisis containment (high mortality outbreaks, salvage strategies)

Callout:
“Value comes from fewer events requiring Level 3 interventions, plus measurable performance stability.”

How to build (data inputs):
No quantitative data required, but you can add “example endpoints” on the side:

Pets: CBPI, locomotion scoring, activity tracking, owner QoL measures

Production: FCR, ADG, mortality, lesion scores, shedding, treatment incidence

How to read (financial message):
This figure protects you from over-claiming while still making the investment case: nutraceuticals monetize because they sit in the high-frequency, long-duration part of care pathways.

Figure II.4. Joint health “credibility ladder”, evidence strength vs commercial maturity

Purpose:
Joint health is the largest recurring-spend category in pet supplements, but it is also where commoditization is highest. This figure shows which actives are “defensible” vs “legacy incumbents.”

Visual concept:
A 2-axis bubble chart:

X-axis: Clinical defensibility (Low to High, based on your Evidence tiers)

Y-axis: Commercial maturity (Commodity to Premium, proxied by how standardized/branded the ingredient is and whether it supports premium claims)

Bubble size: Estimated “presence in joint SKUs” (qualitative if you do not have SKU counts yet)

Example bubbles: EPA/DHA, eggshell membrane complexes, UC-II, green-lipped mussel, glucosamine/chondroitin, Boswellia/curcumin stacks, oral HA

Add a diagonal annotation:
“The premium zone: strong evidence + standardized ingredient story + palatable format.”

How to build (data inputs):
Can be done purely qualitatively. If you want to quantify later:

Use SKU scraping from top retailers, or

Use category share data from market research sources (if licensed)

How to read (financial message):
It explains margin dispersion in a single view:

High-evidence and premium ingredients are less price elastic

Commodity stacks compete on marketing and distribution efficiency





A. Drug-sparing target (what it competes with)

Primary medicines the nutraceutical stack tries to reduce or delay:

NSAIDs (dogs/cats: eg, carprofen, meloxicam; horses: phenylbutazone, flunixin, firocoxib) due to GI, renal, and hepatic risk with chronic use.

Newer OA therapeutics (eg, anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies in pets) are high-efficacy but higher-cost, so “delay escalation” can be a strong economic claim when supported.

Intra-articular therapies (mostly equine): hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, regenerative products.

This is a classic “chronic condition” segment: it supports subscription-like purchasing and premium formats (chews, liquids) when clinical credibility is strong.

B. Ingredients with the strongest veterinary evidence

Omega-3 (EPA/DHA, fish oil)

Evidence: controlled clinical work in dogs shows improved functional outcomes such as weight-bearing in OA when fed EPA/DHA-enriched diets/supplementation (Roush et al. 2010). A systematic review across horses/dogs/cats found overall evidence weak for most nutraceuticals, with omega-3 in dogs being the clearest exception (Vandeweerd et al. 2012).

Green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus)

Evidence: controlled work indicates improvements in pain/mobility proxies; one controlled evaluation concluded GLM alleviated chronic orthopedic pain in dogs but was less effective than carprofen, positioning GLM as an option when NSAIDs cannot be used (Hielm-Björkman et al. 2009). A diet-enrichment study also reports improvements in pain/function measures over time (Rialland et al. 2012).

Eggshell membrane (and “composite” joint chews)

Evidence: a multicenter double-blind RCT in dogs with OA reported improvement on validated owner questionnaires and between-group differences on pain interference; the paper explicitly relates to Movoflex (Ragetly et al. 2025). This supports positioning as a clinically documented joint product rather than generic glucosamine.

C. Ingredients with mixed or emerging evidence (still commercially important)

Undenatured type II collagen (UC-II), often combined

Evidence: RCT data exist; for example a randomized double-blind cross-over study reported improvements on owner mobility scoring with a UC-II plus Boswellia chew versus placebo (Stabile et al. 2024). However, broader OA meta-analyses have rated collagen-based categories as among the weaker positives relative to omega-3 (Barbeau-Grégoire et al. 2022).

Boswellia / curcumin (turmeric)

Evidence: there are controlled studies in dogs, including trials of curcumin plus Boswellia-type combinations that report improvements in OA metrics, but study sizes and heterogeneity often keep this in “promising but not definitive” territory (eg, Caterino et al. 2021).

Oral hyaluronic acid

Evidence exists but is typically narrower (biomarkers, short trials, variable endpoints). It is best positioned as part of a multi-ingredient mobility SKU rather than a single-claim cornerstone unless strong clinical endpoints are shown (Aguado et al. 2021).

Glucosamine + chondroitin

Evidence: systematic evaluation in pets has questioned meaningful efficacy for OA pain and function; a 2022 systematic review/meta-analysis reported a marked non-effect for chondroitin-glucosamine categories, explicitly recommending they should no longer be recommended for OA pain management in dogs/cats (Barbeau-Grégoire et al. 2022). This is crucial for investment: it drives commoditization risk and increases the value of better-evidenced alternatives.

Commercial notes (why this segment monetizes)

Strong willingness to pay: owners perceive mobility as “quality of life.”

Best products behave like maintenance subscriptions (monthly chews).

The moat is clinical substantiation + brand trust, not raw ingredient novelty.



II.2. Gut Health and Microbiome Modulation (Livestock, Aquaculture, Dogs, Cats)

A. Drug-sparing target

Companion animals

Commonly competes with or aims to reduce use of antibiotics frequently prescribed for acute diarrhea (eg, metronidazole), plus symptomatic drugs.

Production animals and aquaculture

Competes with or replaces part of the function of:

Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in jurisdictions where banned or pressured.

Metaphylactic antibiotics and “routine” antimicrobial use.

In pigs, also overlaps with post-weaning diarrhea strategies historically supported by pharmaceutical ZnO, which has been withdrawn in the EU context (EMA referral).

EU context: AGPs have been withdrawn since January 1, 2006, which structurally increased demand for non-antibiotic performance and gut-health tools (Castanon 2007).
US context: veterinary oversight and label changes for medically important antimicrobials in feed have also tightened incentives toward alternatives (FDA VFD overview).

B. Ingredients with strong or investable evidence

Probiotics (species and strain dependent)

Dogs: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial compared a multi-strain probiotic, metronidazole, and placebo in acute diarrhea and supports the idea that well-selected probiotics can be credible alternatives in uncomplicated cases (Shmalberg et al. 2019).

Weaned pigs: meta-analysis evidence supports probiotics improving growth performance and feed efficiency metrics, depending on context and strain (Zimmermann et al. 2016).

Prebiotics (MOS/FOS; “gut architecture” economics)

Broilers: a meta-analysis reported performance effects for mannan-oligosaccharides in broilers, supporting MOS as a production-relevant gut additive category (Hooge 2004).

Synbiotics

Dogs: controlled work in shelter settings found synbiotic administration reduced diarrhea incidence, which is directly monetizable via reduced morbidity and reputational risk in high-density environments (Rose et al. 2017).

Postbiotics and butyrate donors (eg, tributyrin)

Piglets: controlled studies on tributyrin supplementation report improvements in intestinal morphology and growth-related outcomes, supporting post-weaning gut resilience positioning (Chen et al. 2023).

Organic acids (feed hygiene and gut pH economics)

The evidence base is broad and typically framed around antimicrobial effects in the gut and performance, with results depending on matrix and dose. Reviews summarize the role of organic acids as alternatives supportive of performance and gut health in pigs and poultry (Nguyen and Kim 2020).

Clay binders and toxin adsorbents

These are typically justified by mycotoxin risk management; reviews summarize clay minerals as binders/adsorbents in animal production with performance and health implications, but quality varies by binder and toxin spectrum (Döll and Dänicke 2011; more recent syntheses exist).

Commercial notes

In livestock/aquaculture, gut-health products are often sold B2B with ROI logic (FCR, mortality, antibiotic spend).

The moat is often process + application know-how (stability, delivery, premix integration), not only the active ingredient.



Figure II.5. Livestock “post-AGP toolbox”, what replaces antibiotic functions in practice

Purpose:
Clarify a common investor confusion: “antibiotics” in production historically delivered multiple functions (growth, enteric stability, reduced pathogen load). Alternatives typically replace functions, not “the molecule.”

Visual concept:
A stacked bar chart with one bar per species (Swine, Poultry, Aquaculture; optional Ruminants separate).

Each bar is split into functional tool categories:

Enzymes

Probiotics

Organic acids

Postbiotics/butyrate

Phytogenics

Mycotoxin binders

Immunomodulators (beta-glucans, nucleotides)

Add icons or labels for “primary objective” in each species:

Swine: weaning transition, diarrhea risk, uniformity

Poultry: necrotic enteritis risk, litter/gut stability, FCR

Aquaculture: survival, immune resilience, handling stress

How to build (data inputs):

Start qualitative, based on industry practice and the evidence you cite.

Upgrade to quantitative later using:

premix company category sales splits (if obtainable)

industry surveys

formulation prevalence in typical premix programs

How to read (financial message):
It shows why the livestock nutraceutical market is not “one category,” it is a portfolio of functional levers, each with different IP, pricing, and channel dynamics.







II.3. Immunity and Resilience (Aquaculture, Poultry, Swine; plus neonatal mammals)

A. Drug-sparing target

Reduces infectious pressure and therefore antibiotic need or loss events, rather than replacing a single drug.

Often positioned around “stress windows” (weaning, transfer, vaccination, heat stress).

B. Evidence-backed ingredient families

Beta-1,3/1,6-glucans (yeast derivatives)

Aquaculture: reviews describe immunomodulatory and disease resistance roles of beta-glucans in fish, supporting the “resilience” claim set (Meena et al. 2013).

Spray-dried plasma / immunoglobulin-rich fractions

Piglets: reviews summarize use in early life to support performance and gut integrity; often used as part of post-weaning strategies where antimicrobial pressure is high (Torrallardona 2010).

Seaweed and polysaccharides

Controlled feeding trials exist in ruminants and other species with variable endpoints (immunity, oxidative stress, productivity). For example, supplementation research exists in dairy cows focusing on metabolic and immune-related outcomes (Sweeney et al. 2022).

Nucleotides (often yeast-derived)

Poultry: controlled supplementation studies report changes in growth and immune response parameters, supporting immune-resilience positioning (Abdel-Moneim et al. 2020).

Commercial notes

Most “immunity” claims are easiest to monetize in production species via measurable endpoints (mortality, ADG, uniformity), but require careful study design to avoid over-claiming.



II.4. Cognitive Support and Healthy Aging (Senior Dogs and Cats)

A. Drug-sparing target

Adjuncts to, or delay of, pharmacologic management of cognitive dysfunction (eg, selegiline in dogs) and mitigation of comorbid anxiety or sleep disturbances.

B. Evidence-backed levers

Antioxidant-enriched diets

A controlled study in aged dogs reported improved learning performance with an antioxidant-enriched diet (Cotman et al. 2002).

MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides)

Controlled work in aged dogs reported cognitive benefits when diets were enriched with MCTs (Pan et al. 2010). PubMed

Where the evidence is heading

A systematic review of enriched diets and nutraceuticals for cognitive function in aged dogs/cats summarizes the clinical trial landscape and highlights that enriched diets often have higher methodological quality than supplements, while several supplement categories remain promising but heterogeneous (Mellier et al. 2025).

Commercial notes

Monetization often occurs via premium “senior” functional diets and clinically positioned supplement bundles.

The moat is validated endpoints and compliance (palatable formats).



II.5. Calming and Behavioral Wellness (Dogs, Cats, Horses)

A. Drug-sparing target

Aims to reduce reliance on: benzodiazepines, trazodone, SSRIs/clomipramine, alpha-2 agonists, and situational sedatives.

Most credible positioning is: mild to moderate anxiety, situational stress (noise, travel), and behavior plans where owners prefer “natural-first.”

B. Evidence-backed ingredients

Alpha-casozepine (milk protein derivative)

Controlled diet-based work suggests benefit in stress/anxiety contexts (Palestrini et al. 2010). Evidence syntheses in veterinary evidence databases often classify effects as modest and context-dependent. ScienceDirect+1

L-theanine

Clinical evidence exists in dogs for stress-related outcomes in controlled settings (Pike et al. 2015).

Tryptophan

Evidence is mixed and often confounded by diet context and behavioral heterogeneity; it is typically positioned as supportive rather than primary.

CBD (hemp derivatives)

Evidence is developing but regulatory constraints remain material. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated clinical applications and emphasize heterogeneity in product standardization and dose-response (Brioschi et al. 2023).

Commercial notes

This segment is often DTC-led and marketing-sensitive, which increases upside but also regulatory and reputational downside if claims outrun evidence.





Figure II.7. Regulatory timeline and “adoption accelerators” for non-antibiotic solutions

Purpose:
Explain why adoption is structural, not cyclical: regulation changes the baseline operating model, and that changes spending on alternatives.

Visual concept:
A timeline with three lanes:

EU lane: AGP withdrawal era, then subsequent tightening of preventive tools

US lane: increased veterinary oversight (VFD) and antimicrobial stewardship tightening

Global lane: pressure from retailers, integrators, export markets

Overlay markers for “new solution waves”:

enzymes maturation

probiotic mainstreaming

postbiotics/butyrate donors

precision approaches (bacteriophages)

How to build (data inputs):

This can be done with dated policy milestones and a few industry adoption inflection points.

How to read (financial message):
Investors should view certain segments as “regulatory tailwind markets” where adoption is less discretionary.



II.6. Performance, FCR, and Growth (Livestock and Aquaculture; some equine sport use)

A. Drug-sparing target

Primary “replacement” target is the function historically provided by AGPs and high routine antimicrobial use.

Also competes with higher-cost nutritional strategies by offering measurable ROI through FCR and yield.

B. Evidence-backed ingredient families (production economics first)

Enzymes (phytase, xylanase, multi-enzyme complexes)

Phytase: a foundational feed technology for phosphorus utilization; reviews cover its effects on nutrient availability and environmental outputs (Selle and Ravindran 2007).

Xylanase and carbohydrases: reviews describe performance mechanisms and outcomes across monogastrics (Kiarie et al. 2013).

Phytogenics (essential oils and plant extracts)

Reviews summarize phytogenic feed additives as AGP alternatives with variable results by composition and context (Murugesan et al. 2015; Abdelli et al. 2021). Frontiers

Yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

Dairy: meta-analysis of RCTs reports increases in milk production outcomes, supporting a high-confidence ROI narrative for certain yeast culture products (Poppy et al. 2012).

Trace minerals (chelated forms)

Evidence exists but is highly context-specific (baseline deficiency, antagonists, formulation). Investability often comes from proprietary chelation technologies and field ROI proof.

Commercial notes

This is typically a B2B, premix-driven segment where defensibility comes from:

IP (strain, encapsulation, enzyme engineering)

Application data (field trials)

Integration into premix/feed mill workflows



Figure II.6. ROI waterfall, “how a feed additive pays for itself” (production animals)

Purpose:
Make the economic mechanism explicit in a finance-grade way: most livestock nutraceuticals are bought because they reduce losses or improve conversion, not because of “wellness.”

Visual concept:
A waterfall chart showing (example, choose one scenario per species):

Example scenario A (swine weaning)

Baseline: expected performance under stress (lower ADG, higher diarrhea incidence)

Loss components: extra feed per kg gain, mortality, treatments, labor

Additive cost (per ton or per pig)

Additive benefit: improved FCR, reduced diarrhea days, fewer treated animals

Net impact: margin uplift per pig or per batch

Example scenario B (poultry heat stress)

Baseline: heat-stress performance penalty

Benefit blocks: maintained intake, reduced mortality, better carcass quality metrics

Net margin uplift per house

How to build (data inputs):

This figure requires farm economics inputs. If you do not have them yet, include it as “illustrative framework,” and later populate with:

Integrator benchmarks (feed cost, margin per kg, mortality cost)

Peer-reviewed trials reporting FCR deltas

Internal producer case studies

How to read (financial message):
It connects additive pricing power to measurable producer economics and makes the case for why certain categories scale rapidly when antibiotics are restricted.





Summary table 





Figure II.3. Evidence heatmap, “How defensible is each ingredient family by species?”

Purpose:
Show where the clinical and field evidence is strong enough to justify “trust premium” pricing and where claims are mostly marketing.

Visual concept:
A heatmap (or scoreboard table) with:

Rows: key ingredient families (EPA/DHA, green-lipped mussel, eggshell membrane, glucosamine/chondroitin, probiotics, MOS/FOS, synbiotics, organic acids, tributyrin/butyrate donors, beta-glucans, enzymes, phytogenics, MCT, L-theanine, alpha-casozepine)

Columns: Dogs, Cats, Horses, Swine, Poultry, Ruminants, Aquaculture

Cell fill: Evidence tier (A/B/C/D) using a simple legend (A = strongest)

Add a small icon in each cell to indicate what type of evidence dominates:

“RCT” for controlled trials

“Field” for farm trials

“Meta” for meta-analyses/reviews

How to build (data inputs):

You do not need to count every paper. You can code each cell based on the best available evidence you cite in the text.

Optional enhancement: add “regulatory risk” flags for categories like CBD, where frameworks are uneven across jurisdictions.

How to read (financial message):
This figure visually supports valuation logic: strong evidence + standardized actives tend to correlate with premium pricing, better retention, and lower returns risk.







Figure II.8. “Innovation frontier”, time-to-scale vs regulatory friction

Purpose:
Differentiate categories that scale quickly (enzymes, many probiotics) from those with higher uncertainty (novel microbiome engineering, some novel actives).

Visual concept:
A 2x2:

X-axis: Time-to-scale (Short to Long)

Y-axis: Regulatory friction (Low to High)

Place categories:

Enzymes: short time, low friction

Organic acids: short time, low friction

Probiotics: medium time, medium friction (strain claims, stability)

Postbiotics: medium time, medium friction

Bacteriophages: longer time, higher friction (novel authorizations, specificity)

CBD for animals: medium time, high friction (jurisdiction variability)

How to read (financial message):
This becomes your “pipeline risk map” for investors and helps justify valuation dispersion and portfolio strategy.
