# Forms of Veterinary Nutraceuticals by Region and Species

## Global Overview

Globally, veterinary nutraceuticals are delivered in diverse dosage forms tailored to different animal categories. Companion animal supplements often resemble human wellness products (e.g. flavored chews, tablets), while livestock and aquaculture nutraceuticals are typically integrated into feed or water. The choice of format is influenced by ease of administration, animal acceptance, and stability requirements, as well as by regulatory frameworks in each region.

### Companion Animals (Dogs & Cats)

Figure 1: Global pet supplement market by form (2023). Chewable formats (treat-like supplements) dominate the market at roughly 70% of global pet supplement sales by revenue[1], reflecting their convenience and palatability for pets. Pills/tablets and powders make up most of the remainder, with powders gaining popularity for easy mixing into food[2]. Key trends include a shift toward soft chews and other palatable formats to improve owner compliance – owners find it easier to give a treat-like chew than a pill[3]. For example, one leading U.S. brand reported over 600 million soft chews sold in 2023[4], illustrating the massive adoption of chewable nutraceutical treats. Liquid supplements (oral drops or syrups) also exist for pets that resist solids, though they represent a smaller share. Globally, chewables are the preferred format due to ease of dosing and pets’ acceptance[3]. In terms of regulation, pet nutraceuticals are generally marketed as feed supplements or health products rather than medicines. Notably, in North America these products are not classified as pharmaceuticals and thus bypass drug approval (they must simply avoid explicit disease treatment claims)[5]. Similarly, in the EU and other regions they are sold as “complementary feeds” or supplements with limited claims, which influences the formats used (e.g. treat or powder form considered feed) to stay within regulatory boundaries.

### Livestock (Poultry, Swine, Cattle, Small Ruminants)

For livestock, nutraceuticals are most commonly delivered through feed and water. The predominant formats are premixed powders or granules that are incorporated into feed (either as a pre-mix or included in complete feed) and water-soluble powders or liquids added to drinking water. Virtually all commercial feeds for poultry, swine, and ruminants are fortified with vitamin-mineral premixes and functional additives (probiotics, enzymes, phytogenics, etc.), making feed-integrated formats the largest by volume. A 2025 report noted that powder/dry forms account for about 75% of premixes due to stability and ease of mixing[6]. Water-soluble supplements are also widespread – nearly 55% of farms globally use water-soluble vitamins/minerals dosed via drinking water[7]. This format allows quick mass administration (e.g. adding electrolytes, probiotics, or organic acids to water during stress periods). Trends: Post-antibiotic-ban, farmers have increased use of nutraceutical feed additives for gut health and immunity, especially in poultry and swine. For example, the EU’s ban on antibiotic growth promoters and recent phase-out of zinc oxide in piglets have driven adoption of feed additives (probiotics, acids) in premix form, and farmers often use water-based nutraceuticals during critical phases (weaning, heat stress). Globally, Asia-Pacific leads in water-soluble supplement usage due to its large poultry and aquaculture sectors and emphasis on feed efficiency[8]. Technological trends include microencapsulation and coated formats to protect active ingredients through feed processing and in the digestive tract. This is important for heat-sensitive or water-soluble nutrients – for instance, encapsulation is used to stabilize vitamins/probiotics in feed so they don’t degrade or leach, ensuring they reach the animal effectively[9][10]. In terms of regulatory context, most livestock nutraceuticals are regulated as feed additives or nutritional supplements rather than drugs. In the EU, any ingredient added to feed for health or growth benefits must be authorized under feed additive regulations before marketing[11]. This means formats like premixes or water-soluble powders for feed use undergo approval for safety/efficacy, whereas therapeutic claims would trigger veterinary drug regulation. Other regions similarly channel these products through feed laws; for example, U.S. producers use generally recognized as safe (GRAS) additives in feed and must avoid drug-like claims. Thus, delivering nutraceuticals in feed or water keeps them within feed regulatory pathways, whereas an injectable or bolus making health claims might be treated as a drug in some jurisdictions.

### Aquaculture (Fish & Shrimp)

In aquaculture, nutraceuticals are crucial for promoting fish and shrimp health in intensive systems. The common format is feed-based: functional ingredients (e.g. probiotics, prebiotics, immunostimulants, vitamins) are mixed into feed pellets or coated onto them. These typically start as dry powders premixed into feed during manufacturing, sometimes with special coatings to prevent dissolution in water. Stability is a key concern – once feed enters water, nutrients can leach out. Therefore, microencapsulated feed additives are widely used to ensure the supplement remains stable until consumed[9]. For example, slow-release vitamin C and amino acids are microencapsulated in fish/shrimp feeds so they don’t wash out, delivering the nutrients effectively to the animal[12][10]. Water-applied nutraceuticals are also popular, especially in shrimp farming: farmers may broadcast probiotic powders or herbal extracts directly into ponds to improve water quality and animal health. In Asia, many shrimp producers add probiotics to water or top-coat feed at the farm level[13], which indicates significant usage of water-dispersible supplement formats. While exact market share by format is hard to quantify (because feed-based and water-based use often complement each other), the bulk of nutraceutical volume goes through feed mills as incorporated feed additives. Trends: As aquaculture expands (particularly in APAC), there is growing use of advanced feed additives that can withstand pelleting/extrusion and marine conditions. Coated and encapsulated forms are on the rise to ensure thermo-stability and targeted release in the gut (addressing issues like leaching and bioavailability). There is also a trend toward all-natural functional feeds (using plant extracts, prebiotics, etc.), which requires innovative formats to maintain efficacy. Regulatory context: Aquaculture nutraceuticals in feed are generally treated as feed additives/nutritional feed ingredients. For instance, in the EU they need authorization similar to livestock feed additives (with special attention to environmental safety for open-water use). Many Asia-Pacific countries have their own feed additive approval lists for aquafeed, though enforcement varies. In all cases, delivering these substances via feed avoids classification as veterinary drugs. However, when supplements are used in water (affecting the environment), regulators may also require safety assurances (e.g. residue-free, no harm to environment[14]). Overall, the format (feed-incorporated vs. water-applied) can influence the approval pathway – feed-incorporated nutraceuticals typically go through feed regulation, whereas water treatments might be subject to environmental or aquaculture product regulations in some regions.

## North America (United States/Canada)

### Companion Animals (Dogs & Cats)

In North America, the companion animal nutraceutical market is well-developed, and soft chews are the marquee format. The U.S. pet supplements market is the largest globally[15], with American pet owners particularly fond of chewable treats for supplements. Common formats include soft chews (often bacon or peanut butter flavored for dogs), chewable tablets, capsules, powders to sprinkle on food, and liquids. Market share: Chewables hold the largest share in this region, mirroring the global trend – industry reports confirm that in 2023 chewable forms were the top format by sales in the U.S.[16][17]. Tablets and capsules (often hidden in treats by owners) are secondary, while powders and liquids are niche (used for pets that won’t eat chews or need flexible dosing). Trends: There is a marked shift toward palatable chew formats and even gummy-like supplements for pets, driven by the desire for easy administration and the humanization trend (pet supplements that resemble human wellness chews)[3]. Joint health chews, calming chews, and multivitamin bites are booming. At the same time, some pet owners seek alternatives like liquid supplements (e.g. liquid multivitamins or CBD oil) for faster absorption and easier mixing[18]. Another trend is natural/organic ingredients, which often come in powder form (e.g. green-lipped mussel powder for joints) to mix with food, though this remains a smaller segment. Regulatory context: In the U.S. and Canada, pet nutraceuticals are regulated as animal supplements or feeds, not drugs. They do not require pre-market approval as long as no therapeutic claims are made. The FDA (CVM) and AAFCO oversee ingredient safety/definitions, but there is no formal “veterinary nutraceutical” category – they typically fall under “dietary supplements” or feed additives. As a result, format choice is driven by consumer preference more than regulation, and companies often use food-like formats (chews, treats) to emphasize that these are not medications. Labels must include disclaimers (e.g. “not intended to treat or cure disease” as per FDA requirements)[5], but no veterinary prescription is needed for these supplement formats.

### Livestock

North American livestock operations consume nutraceuticals mostly via feed additives and premixes. The U.S. has an extensive commercial feed industry – virtually all poultry and swine feed is fortified with vitamins, minerals, and often supplemented with direct-fed microbials or botanicals as growth and health promoters. Thus, the premix/feed-integrated format (dry mash or pellet additives) dominates. Water-soluble supplements are also used, particularly in poultry and swine barns: farmers commonly add vitamin-electrolyte powders to drinking water during stress (transport, heat waves) or use water-administered probiotics for young animals. While precise shares are not published, feed-integrated formats likely account for the vast majority of volume (since every ton of feed carries premix), with water supplements used intermittently. Trends: Since the mid-2010s, North America has reduced antibiotic use and embraced feed nutraceuticals – e.g. probiotics and phytogenics saw increased use in broiler and pig diets as alternatives to growth-promoting antibiotics. The format of these is typically a stabilized dry additive mixed into feed, sometimes encapsulated to survive pelleting. There’s also interest in specialty boluses or drenches for cattle: for example, slow-release nutritional boluses for grazing cattle (providing minerals/probiotics over time) are available, though their use is relatively limited compared to feed mix. Regulatory context: The U.S. treats these products as feed additives or “generally recognized as safe” ingredients. No FDA drug approval is required if they are marketed for nutrition or productivity support (not disease cure). The Veterinary Feed Directive (enacted 2017) brought antibiotics under veterinary oversight, indirectly boosting nutraceutical use, but it does not restrict nutritional supplements. As long as the format is something like a feed mix, block, or water additive with approved ingredients, it can be sold freely. Canada similarly regulates most as feed, requiring pre-market assessment for certain new feed ingredients but not classifying them as drugs if no therapeutic claims. Overall, North American farmers have freedom to use various formats (feed premix, water-solubles, licks, boluses) as supplements, and the choice is typically based on farm management convenience and the target animal’s needs rather than regulatory mandate.

### Aquaculture

North America’s aquaculture sector (e.g. salmon farming in Canada/US, catfish farming in the US South) utilizes nutraceuticals largely through formulated feeds. Commercial fish feeds are enriched with vitamins, minerals, pigments (for salmon flesh color), and sometimes functional additives like probiotics or immune boosters. These are provided as pelleted or extruded feeds containing the nutraceutical in a stable form. Common formats: Dry additives mixed into feed premix dominate; in some cases, oil-based liquids are coated onto pellets after extrusion (for heat-sensitive nutrients like certain vitamins or omega-3 enhancers). Water-based application of nutraceuticals is less common in North America since many operations are in open-water systems (cages) or flow-through tanks where treating the water is impractical or costly. However, hatcheries may use water-soluble treatments (e.g. adding probiotics to rearing tanks or baths for young fish). Trends: With high-value species like salmon, there’s an emphasis on functional feeds – e.g. feeds containing prebiotics, seaweed extracts, or yeast beta-glucans to improve fish gut health and disease resistance. These are delivered in feed pellet form for precise dosing. There is also growing interest in alternatives to formal chemical treatments – for instance, using garlic or herbal extracts in feed as antiparasitics. This has driven innovation in encapsulation techniques to ensure these additives don’t degrade during feed manufacturing and storage. Regulatory context: In the US, feed additives for aquaculture follow the same regime as other feed additives. Ingredients like vitamins or yeast extracts are generally recognized as safe, while any novel substances would go through an AAFCO definition process or FDA review. Because format can affect whether something is considered a “drug” (e.g. adding a substance to water to treat fish could be seen as a veterinary treatment), most nutraceutical uses are kept within feed to avoid regulatory hurdles. Canada likewise regulates aquaculture supplements as feeds. North American regulators pay special attention to environmental impact of aquaculture additives (to ensure no harmful accumulation in water), but palatable feed-based delivery is the standard, so format choice (feed vs water) is guided by both efficacy and the need to comply with environmental guidelines for aquaculture.

## Europe (EU)

### Companion Animals (Dogs & Cats)

The European pet nutraceutical market has been expanding, following similar patterns to North America with a slight lag. Common formats in the EU include chewable supplements (soft chews or chewable tablets), powders, and tablets/capsules. Traditionally, many European owners used tablet supplements (often given in cheese or pill pockets), but palatable chews are rapidly gaining popularity. In 2022, the chewable format held the largest share of the Europe pet supplements market[19][20], reflecting a shift toward treat-like products. Soft chews adapted for Europe (sometimes formulated without certain preservatives/additives to meet EU standards) are increasingly on shelves. For example, U.S. brands of soft chews have entered Europe, indicating demand – Swedencare’s introduction of NaturVet chews in 2024 highlights this trend (over 600 million soft chews sold in the U.S. in 2023, now being offered in the EU)[4]. Powder supplements (to mix with pet food) remain in use, especially for cats or for “natural” product enthusiasts, and oral liquids or pastes are occasionally used for picky animals (e.g. malt paste for hairballs, which doubles as a supplement). Trends: European pet owners are increasingly seeking natural and functional ingredients, which has led to more herbal supplement products (often in powdered form) and breed-specific or condition-specific supplements (like joint chews for large breed dogs). There is also growth in cat supplements (palatable paste or chewable treats for felines) as cats become a bigger part of the pet market. Regulatory context: The EU does not have a “pet nutraceutical” category per se – these products are typically marketed as complementary feeds or dietetic feeds. That means they are subject to general feed safety and labeling regulations rather than medicinal law, as long as no medicinal claims are made. Format can influence this: a chew or powder given with meals is clearly a feed supplement, whereas a pill claiming to treat a condition could be viewed by regulators as an unauthorized veterinary medicine. EU feed additive rules (Regulation EC 1831/2003) apply if the supplement includes certain functional additives above nutritional levels. Thus, companies carefully word claims (e.g. “supports joint health” instead of “treats arthritis”) and offer formats consistent with a nutritional use. The result is that most EU pet supplements are sold in feed-like formats (chew, powder) to stay within feed regulations. If a product’s format or claim crossed into medicinal territory, it would require EMA/EU veterinary medicinal approval, which few if any pet supplements have. The UK, although no longer in the EU, follows similar principles (see next section), so the European context strongly favors nutraceuticals being in food-like forms with appropriate regulatory positioning.

### Livestock

In the EU, feed-integrated formats are the cornerstone of livestock nutraceutical use, underpinned by stringent regulations on medicated products. Common formats: Premixes of vitamins, minerals, and approved additives (like probiotics, enzymes, organic acids, phytogenics) are blended into compound feeds for poultry, swine, cattle, and small ruminants. These premixes are usually dry powders or granules. Farmers and feed mills also use concentrated additive preparations (powders or liquids) to mix into rations. Water-soluble powders are another important format, used to deliver supplements via drinking water – for example, EU poultry producers often use water-soluble vitamins, acidifiers, or oregano oil extracts in the drink lines, especially post-antibiotic ban as health promoters. Mineral lick blocks and boluses are used too (e.g. mineral blocks for grazing sheep/cattle, or boluses providing slow-release trace elements or probiotics for cows), though these are a smaller segment compared to feed mixing. Relative usage: The vast majority of nutraceutical volume goes through feed. Every commercial feed in Europe is fortified, which means premix formats dominate usage. Water-soluble supplements are widely used short-term (e.g. ~55% of farms globally use them[7], and EU farms are among them, especially for poultry/pigs during stress or disease recovery). Trends: Europe has been at the forefront of antibiotic-free feeding, so there’s high adoption of alternative nutraceutical additives. Since the 2006 AGP (antibiotic growth promoter) ban, use of phytogenic feed additives (herbs, essential oils), acidifiers, and probiotics has surged – these typically come as stable premix formulas. A trend is toward encapsulated additives that can target release in specific gut segments (especially for young animals with immature gut), and toward combination products (e.g. synbiotics that combine probiotics + prebiotics in one premix). Additionally, with the 2022 ban on therapeutic ZnO in piglet feed, farmers turned to water-soluble organic acids or electrolyte supplements at weaning, boosting that format. Regulatory context: The EU’s heavy regulatory oversight shapes format use. Only authorized feed additives can be used in feed – so companies have invested in getting approval for substances like certain probiotic strains or plant extracts. The format must align with these approvals; for example, a probiotic approved as a feed additive will be sold in a premix format with a specified potency. If a nutraceutical is not authorized, it cannot be added to feed legally. However, some products skirt this by marketing as “dietetic complementary feeds” with broad claims. In all cases, any hint of treating or preventing disease could reclassify the product as a veterinary medicine. Thus, EU livestock nutraceuticals stick to feed/water formats and structure-function claims. The rigorous feed additive authorization process means formats that are clearly feed (mixes, powders, liquids added to feed/water) are the path to market[11]. Farmers in the EU generally cannot use compounded “supplements” freely unless the ingredients are on the allowed list. This has resulted in a well-regulated but slightly less flexible market compared to, say, the U.S. – yet it ensures quality and safety of the premix and supplement formats that are used.

### Aquaculture

Europe’s aquaculture (notably salmon farming in Scandinavia and trout, seabass, carp farming in the EU) relies on nutritionally complete feeds where nutraceuticals are embedded. Formats: The primary format is medicated or functional feed pellets. Feed mills produce pellets that include nutraceutical additives such as vitamins (e.g. vitamin C for immune support), pigments like astaxanthin (for salmon color, considered a nutraceutical pigment), and sometimes immunostimulants (e.g. beta-glucans, seaweed extracts). These additives are often added via premix to the feed or by coating the pellets with liquid supplements post-extrusion. Water-administered nutraceuticals are uncommon in open-water fish farming (you cannot treat the ocean or large ponds practically), but in hatcheries or recirculating systems, some farmers use soluble probiotics or salt/herbal baths for fish – though those border more on husbandry practice than measured nutraceutical dosing. Trends: European aquaculture places emphasis on sustainability and fish welfare, so there’s growing interest in nutraceuticals to improve disease resistance and reduce need for antibiotics or chemical treatments. For example, functional feeds containing garlic or thyme extracts (for anti-parasitic effect) or probiotic Bacillus strains (for gut health) are being developed. The challenge is ensuring these work in the pelleted feed format; hence, microencapsulation and heat-stable forms are trending. Research projects (often EU-funded) have been exploring algae-based supplements or alternative proteins that carry nutraceutical benefits (like microalgae rich in immunonutrients, pressed into feed form). Regulatory context: All ingredients in aquafeed in the EU must either be authorized feed additives or approved feed materials. Europe is strict here: even colorants like astaxanthin are regulated feed additives with maximum inclusion levels. So nutraceutical formats tend to be feed-bound to fit the feed laws. If a farmer wanted to dose something via water, it might fall under veterinary medicine regulations if it’s treating disease in fish (e.g. a herbal tea for parasites could be seen as a treatment). Therefore, the industry keeps solutions within feed where they are regulated as feed additives or novel ingredients. Additionally, environmental regulations in Europe’s aquaculture are tight – any supplement in feed can end up in the water via feces, so risk assessments are required during additive approval to ensure no ecosystem harm. As a result, European aquaculture nutraceuticals are delivered almost exclusively in feed pellet format, with a premium on formats that are stable (do not leach) and safe for the environment.

## United Kingdom

(Note: The UK, having left the EU, now regulates feeds and supplements independently but still aligns closely with EU standards in practice.)

### Companion Animals (Dogs & Cats)

The UK pet supplement market is robust and broadly mirrors trends seen in North America and Europe. Common formats: Tablets and capsules have been long-standing (with several UK brands historically offering herbal tablets for pets), but soft chews and palatable bites are increasingly popular among British pet owners. Many UK pet parents give joint support or multivitamin chews as a daily treat. Powders (e.g. powdered seaweed, brewers yeast) are used by some, typically sprinkled on food. Market preferences: Chewable formats are on the rise; the UK is often considered a nation of pet lovers who are willing to try new products, so the acceptance of U.S.-style soft chews has grown quickly. (For example, pet-specific soft chew brands like PetHonesty and Zesty Paws have expanded into the UK market recently, indicating demand for those formats.) While exact UK-form data is not separately reported from Europe, chewables likely make up the largest share in the UK as well, followed by tablets and powders. Trends: One noticeable trend is veterinarian-formulated supplements in palatable form – UK vet practices sometimes stock joint chews or skin health chews that owners find easier to administer than pills. Additionally, natural remedy supplements (often herbal blends) are popular in the UK; these might come in powder or capsule form, but some are being made into flavored pastes or soft chews to improve palatability. There is also growing interest in pet CBD oil in the UK, an outlier format (liquid dropper) used for anxiety or pain, though its regulatory status is in flux. Regulatory context: The UK’s regulations for pet supplements are comparable to the EU’s. Post-Brexit, the UK requires that pet supplements be either approved feed additives or fall under feed material/complementary feed rules. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) monitors products that make medicinal claims. Thus, UK pet nutraceuticals are marketed with general health claims and in food-like formats. A soft chew or sprinkle powder is clearly a supplement; if someone tried to sell a “disease-curing pill” for pets, the VMD would likely intervene. The format itself can influence perception – for example, a product sold as a “treat” with added glucosamine is seen as a feed, whereas the same pill in a blister pack might raise eyebrows as an unlicensed medicine. The UK continues to uphold high standards on safety and labeling, often requiring evidence of ingredient efficacy indirectly via consumer protection laws. In summary, UK pet supplements are delivered in formats that pet owners find appealing (chews, etc.) and regulators find acceptable as non-medicinal (feed-type) products.

### Livestock

UK livestock farming employs nutraceuticals much like the rest of Europe. Formats: Feed-based inclusion is the norm – premixes and complete feeds with additives. The UK feed industry, once under EU rules, now has its own register but remains aligned, so all the vitamins, minerals, probiotics, etc., go into feed via approved premix. Water-soluble supplements are also used on UK farms (e.g. farmers dissolve vitamin packs in water for poultry during heat stress or give calves electrolyte solutions in water during transport). Additionally, nutritional boluses are somewhat popular in UK cattle and sheep management – for instance, slow-release mineral boluses for grazing cattle in areas with nutrient deficiencies, or boluses providing cobalt and selenium to sheep. These boluses are nutritional in nature and considered “controlled-release supplements.” Trends: The UK has been proactive in reducing antibiotic use (even ahead of EU mandates in some cases) and promoting alternatives. This has led to greater use of probiotic feed additives in poultry and acidifiers in pig diets, delivered via feed. One trend in the UK is the use of seaweed-derived supplements (algae meal) in ruminant diets to improve gut health and even reduce methane; these are added to feed in powdered form. Another is an interest in essential oil blends as feed additives for both poultry and cattle (for example, thyme and citrus extracts to improve gut microflora). Format-wise, these often come as a premix or encapsulated beadlets mixed into feed. Regulatory context: The UK now approves feed additives through its own process (operated by the Food Standards Agency and VMD for feed additives, essentially mirroring EFSA’s role). All products added to feeds must be on the GB feed additive register or be recognized feed materials. The departure from the EU has not led to format changes – UK farmers still get their supplements through feed companies in the same powder or liquid formats. If anything, the UK might exercise a bit more flexibility in allowing certain supplements (for instance, some pet supplement ingredients not yet authorized in EU feed might be considered case-by-case in the UK now). However, for food-producing animals, the format remains strictly feed or water – there’s no concept of a “nutraceutical drug” in a different form. If a supplement were marketed as treating a disease in livestock, UK regulators would require it to be licensed as a veterinary medicine. Therefore, like the EU, the UK keeps nutraceuticals in the feed domain: farmers use feed blends, licks, and water additives that comply with feed regulations. The bolus format used in the UK for minerals is considered a veterinary device or feed item (depending on claims) and is allowed as a route to ensure nutrient delivery without daily feeding, illustrating that as long as the bolus claims nutritional benefit (not curing disease), it’s an accepted format under feed rules.

### Aquaculture

The UK’s aquaculture is primarily salmon farming in Scotland, with some trout and shellfish farming. Nutraceutical delivery in the UK aquaculture is done via feed pellets almost exclusively. Salmon feeds produced in the UK or imported are fortified with all necessary vitamins, pigments, and often extras like antioxidants (e.g. organic selenium, vitamin E) to boost fish health and flesh quality. Common formats: dry additives mixed into feed, and oil-based nutrient supplements coated on pellets (salmon feed pellets are often vacuum-coated with oils to increase energy density; during that process, heat-sensitive nutraceuticals can be applied). Use of waterborne supplements is minimal – salmon are in sea pens or large tanks where treating the water with supplements would be inefficient and costly. However, hatcheries might treat young fish with salt or probiotic baths; these are more management practices than routine nutraceutical dosing. Trends: UK salmon farmers are interested in nutraceuticals that can help with issues like sea lice resistance or stress from warming waters. For example, feeds containing extra vitamin C and B vitamins are given prior to handling or vaccinating fish to reduce stress impacts. There’s research in the UK on functional feed ingredients like macroalgae (kelp) or insect meal that might confer health benefits – these would be integrated into feed if adopted. Stability and palatability are key – any additive must not deter fish from eating or else it’s counterproductive. The trend is toward highly digestible feeds with functional additives that improve gut health (to reduce disease outbreaks in net pens). Regulatory context: The UK aligns with EU standards for aquafeed additives – any nutraceutical used must be an approved feed ingredient. Post-Brexit, the UK has maintained the same authorized additives list for aquaculture initially, so formats haven’t changed. Should UK wish to approve new additives faster, it might in the future, but the format (feed-based) will remain because that’s the accepted route. As with livestock, any attempt to medicate via supplements (for example, a claim to prevent a fish disease) would put the product under veterinary medicine regulations. Thus, UK aquaculture companies and feed producers ensure that these health-boosting ingredients are presented as nutritional improvements in feed. The feed pellet format is effectively the only practical and legal means to deliver nutraceuticals to fish in the UK. This also simplifies compliance with environmental regulations, since any additive in feed has been evaluated for safety to the environment (important for open-water farming). In conclusion, UK aquaculture uses nutraceuticals in feed form similarly to Norway/EU, focusing on feed-based formats that are stable in water and compliant with feed (not drug) regulations.

## Asia-Pacific (APAC)

(APAC region includes major markets like China, India, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Australia, which have diverse practices; this summary highlights broad regional tendencies.)

### Companion Animals (Dogs & Cats)

The APAC companion animal nutraceutical market is rapidly growing, driven by increasing pet ownership in countries like China and India and a cultural shift toward pet “humanization”. Common formats: Traditional formats such as powders and pills have been common in some Asian markets (e.g. sprinkling calcium powder on home-cooked pet food, or giving a vitamin pill). However, as the market matures, chewable and treat-like supplements are becoming popular in APAC as well. Multinational brands have introduced soft chews and palatable tablets in markets like Japan, South Korea, and China, where urban pet owners eagerly adopt convenient products. Market share: While detailed data by format in APAC is sparse, chewables are gaining ground quickly and likely form a significant portion of new sales, especially in more developed markets (Japan’s pet supplement market, for example, has many chewable skin & coat and joint products). In developing APAC markets, powders and liquids (like herbal tonics or vitamin drops) are still used, often because they can be mixed with the pet’s regular diet. Trends: A key trend is local ingredient supplements – e.g. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbs in pet supplements in China (often delivered as powders or tablets), or Ayurveda-inspired herbal supplements for pets in India. These sometimes come in format of sprinkle powders or pills wrapped in treats. At the same time, international formats like soft chews are being localized (flavors that appeal to local tastes, smaller chew sizes for small breed dogs popular in Asia, etc.). Another trend is the increasing influence of e-commerce: APAC pet owners often buy imported supplement products online, so formats successful in the West (chews, etc.) are reaching APAC consumers quickly. Regulatory context: APAC is diverse. In some countries (e.g. Japan), pet supplements are lightly regulated as quasi-food products, so companies have freedom in format; Japan’s market has everything from gummies to yogurt-like probiotic drinks for pets. In China, regulation is tightening – pet supplements may fall under feed regulations now, requiring product registration, which influences format (chews and powders would be registered akin to feed supplements). Many Asia-Pacific countries do not yet have a clear category for “pet nutraceutical,” so as long as the product is safe and not making drug claims, it can be sold. This means formats are chosen for consumer appeal foremost. However, some markets (like Australia) treat certain pet supplements more strictly (they might require listing as veterinary products if claiming therapeutic benefit). Overall, APAC’s regulatory landscape is evolving: there’s a trend toward more oversight (e.g. India has been considering supplement standards, China has new pet food/supplement regulations). If a country classifies a pet supplement as feed, then soft chews, powders, etc., must meet feed-labeling standards. In practice, APAC pet supplement formats are broad-ranging – from Western-style chewables to traditional herbal powders – and regulators are gradually shaping rules that will likely align these products with feed or food supplement laws.

### Livestock

The Asia-Pacific region is a massive producer of poultry, swine, and aquaculture products, and thus a huge consumer of feed additives and nutraceuticals. Formats: Feed premixes are extensively used – countries like China, India, Thailand, and Vietnam have large feed mills mixing vitamins, amino acids, enzymes, and other supplements into animal feed. Many APAC nations import premix or additive blends from global suppliers (DSM, ADM, etc.), which arrive as powders or granules to blend locally. At the farm level, water-soluble supplements are very popular, perhaps even more so than in the West: small-scale farmers can easily dose water with packets of vitamins or herbal extracts. Indeed, it’s noted that a majority of farms use water supplements, and APAC in particular has embraced them (with one report highlighting Asia-Pacific as the leading consumer of water-soluble vitamin/mineral supplements in livestock)[8]. For example, in tropical countries, sachets of electrolyte/vitamin powder are routinely added to poultry drinking water to combat heat stress. Other formats: You also see medicated block supplements in some APAC regions (for instance, urea-molasses nutrient blocks for cattle in India, which include herbal additives). Trends: APAC is experiencing a push to reduce antibiotic use (China banned antibiotic growth promoters in feed in 2020, for instance), so alternative nutraceuticals are booming. This includes probiotics and acidifiers in pig and poultry feed – usually added via premix – and phytogenic additives (like essential oil blends) gaining popularity for their perceived “natural” benefits. Because many smaller or medium farmers do not always have sophisticated feed formulations, a trend has been the rise of ready-made supplement packs sold in the market – e.g. a “growth promoter premix” or “herbal liver tonic” – which the farmer can mix into feed or water. These often come as powdered packets or liquid bottles. Asia also has innovative uses like fermented herbal supplements prepared on farm (especially in countries like Vietnam or Indonesia, where farmers ferment plant extracts as a probiotic drink for pigs – a very localized format). With large integrators (like CP Group in Thailand or Wen’s in China), custom feed additive blends (like encapsulated butyrate, enzyme cocktails, etc.) are mixed into feeds at the mill for maximal efficiency. Regulatory context: Regulatory oversight varies. China has a system similar to the EU’s for feed additives – only approved additives can be used and they must be on an approved list. Thus, in China’s commercial feeds, formats are controlled (approved premix components only). However, in the broader Asian market, enforcement can be looser, and a plethora of “tonics” and “boosters” are sold without stringent approval, especially at the small farm level. For example, in Southeast Asia, one might find over-the-counter packets of multi-vitamin antibiotics (though antibiotics in supplements are now being curbed) or enzyme blends that farmers use at will. The format might determine the path: a premix bag sold to feed mills goes through a formal registration (as feed additive) in countries like India or Vietnam, whereas a small bottle marketed as a “herbal poultry booster” might bypass feed laws if considered a herbal product. That is changing as governments raise feed safety standards. Countries like Thailand and Indonesia are aligning more with international standards, requiring registration of feed supplements, which often involves demonstrating safety. So, Asia-Pacific is trending toward formalizing nutraceuticals under feed regulations – meaning products need to fit feed-use formats (powders, liquids for feed/water) and meet labeling requirements. Still, the sheer diversity in APAC means at any given time, farmers might be using both well-regulated premix additives and informal home-brewed remedies. In summary, feed and water formats dominate delivery of nutraceuticals in APAC livestock, with rapid growth in usage, and regulators gradually tightening how these supplement formats are approved and used.

### Aquaculture

The Asia-Pacific region dominates global aquaculture (China alone produces well over half of the world’s farmed fish and shrimp). Nutraceutical usage in APAC aquaculture is widespread, in both feed-based and water-based forms. Common formats: Medicated or supplemented feeds are a primary mode – commercial fish/shrimp feeds in Asia often include additives like immune boosters (e.g. beta-glucans, vitamins) or growth promoters (e.g. nucleotide supplements), mixed in during feed manufacture. These are usually dry powdered additives added to feed mash, or sometimes liquids coated on pellets (e.g. oils with vitamins). However, a significant portion of Asian aquaculture, especially in shrimp and some freshwater fish farming, involves farmers preparing or modifying feed at the farm. They may top-dress feed with nutraceuticals (sprinkling or spraying a powder on pellets before feeding) or use farm-made feed balls with herbal ingredients. Additionally, direct water additives are very prevalent: farmers add probiotic cultures, enzymes, or herbal extracts to pond water to improve water quality and reduce pathogen load. For instance, tossing a bacterial powder into shrimp ponds nightly to maintain beneficial bacteria is standard practice in parts of Vietnam and India. One source notes that many Asian producers add probiotics to water or feed at the farm level, though this can be labor-intensive[13]. Trends: Given disease challenges (e.g. viral diseases in shrimp, parasitic infestations in fish), APAC aquaculture has a trend of using functional feeds and bioremediation. Probiotics are used not just as a gut supplement but to treat the water (consume waste, outcompete pathogens). Thus, dual-format strategies (feed + water) are common – feed contains baseline nutraceuticals, and additional doses go into water during critical periods. There’s also a trend toward improved stability: recognizing that traditional additives often leach out in water, Asian feed manufacturers are adopting technologies like coating and microencapsulation (sometimes licensing these from Western firms) to make feed additives more water-stable for shrimp/fish. Local innovations are seen too: for example, in India, trials of turmeric or neem extracts in feed (as natural immunostimulants) have led to pelleted supplements; in China, traditional herbs are formulated into aquafeed additives (in powder form) to enhance disease resistance in carp. Regulatory context: As with livestock, APAC aquaculture regulations range from rigorous (e.g. Australia and Japan have strict controls on feed ingredients, requiring pre-approval for additives in fish feed) to lenient (some countries historically had little oversight on what farmers add to ponds). China has been strengthening regulation of aquafeed – now all commercial feeds and premixes must use Ministry-approved additives and feed materials. Thus, format-wise, any additive included in manufactured feed in China must be on the approved list and used per guidelines. Meanwhile, the water additive space is a bit grey – some countries treat pond treatments as environmental products or simply don’t regulate them tightly, meaning farmers can add, say, a fermented rice bran probiotic brew without legal barriers. However, there is increasing attention on residue and food safety: if a water additive could leave residues in seafood, authorities might step in. For example, Thailand has cracked down on unapproved chemicals in shrimp ponds; this encourages use of safe nutraceuticals (probiotics, etc.) which are format-wise simple powders. In summation, APAC aquaculture employs nutraceuticals in feed (dominant, especially for large-scale operations) and water (crucial for small farms and disease management). The formats are typically powder or liquid concentrates. Regulators are moving toward ensuring feed-based supplements are authorized (thus pushing more of the usage into properly formulated feeds), but farmers still widely use water-applied formats as immediate interventions. The interplay of these methods in APAC makes it unique – essentially an all-of-the-above approach to nutraceutical delivery – and format choices are dictated by what is effective and available, within the gradually tightening regulatory frameworks that each country is establishing.
