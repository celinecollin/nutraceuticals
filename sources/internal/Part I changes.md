# Part I changes.docx

Optional: 2 figure ideas that make Part I “investment friendly”

These are high impact and low effort because you already have the content.

Figure I.A “Regulatory classification decision tree”

A one-page flow that starts with:

Species / use case (pet vs food-producing animal)

Delivery form (in feed, in water, oral dose form)

Claim type (support/maintain vs treat/prevent)

Likely legal bucket by region (US: food vs drug; EU/UK: feed vs VMP)

Outcome: visually shows why two identical products can face different go-to-market constraints depending on claims and region.

Figure I.B “Claims risk heat map”

Matrix:

Rows: common claims (joint comfort, mobility, gut health, calm, immune, arthritis pain relief, anti-inflammatory, renal support)

Columns: US / EU / UK

Cell color: Low risk (structure-function) to high risk (medicinal claim / likely reclassification)

Outcome: instantly communicates “what can be said” and therefore how brands compete.

Figure I.C “EU moat vs US speed” schematic (investor angle)

A simple 2x2:

X-axis: Time-to-market

Y-axis: Defensibility / regulatory moat
Populate:

EU authorised zootechnical additive (high moat, slower)

US pet supplement (fast, lower moat, higher enforcement sensitivity)

UK GB feed additive route (potentially faster than EU, still structured)

Outcome: connects regulation to value creation mechanics.

Regulatory Landscape by Region

































Horses (routine-driven, precision and practicality):
In equine, nutraceutical delivery sits between the pet and production models. Daily feeding routines make top-dressed powders, pellets, and balancers the dominant formats, because they allow repeatable dosing without pill administration. For situations where timing matters (competition, transport, acute stress windows), oral pastes/syringes and concentrated liquids are frequently preferred to ensure rapid administration and reduce “feed refusal” risk. In practice, equine products also need tighter attention to batch consistency, traceability, and label discipline, because professional users (trainers, yards, sport-horse owners) expect predictable outcomes and conservative ingredient profiles.
