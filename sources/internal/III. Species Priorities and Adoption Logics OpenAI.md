III. Species Priorities and Adoption Logics



The addressable veterinary nutraceutical market is best understood through a species lens because adoption drivers, regulatory constraints, and monetisation pathways vary materially between companion animals and production systems. In practice, the sector splits into two distinct demand engines:

Companion animals: demand is driven by owner willingness to pay, chronic care, and “quality of life” outcomes, with brand and format (palatability, convenience) acting as key differentiators.

Livestock and aquaculture: demand is driven by measurable return on investment (ROI), productivity, and compliance with tightening antimicrobial and environmental constraints, with efficacy, consistency, and integration into feeding systems as key differentiators.

III.1. Companion animals (dogs and cats)


In Europe, the total pet population (excluding aquaria) is estimated at 282 million, including approximately 90 million dogs and 108 million cats (FEDIAF, 2025). In the United States, the pet economy remains structurally large: $151.9 billion in total industry expenditures in 2024, with $39.8 billion in veterinary care and product sales (APPA, 2025). US household penetration is high, with 94 million US households owning a pet, including 68 million dog-owning households and 49 million cat-owning households (APPA, 2025). 

III.1.1. Why nutraceutical adoption is structurally attractive in pets


Adoption is anchored in chronic, non-curative conditions where owners accept recurring spend and where products are positioned as prevention, maintenance, or adjunct support. Two disease clusters are particularly important for “repeat purchase” economics: 

Musculoskeletal aging and pain management: prevalence estimates commonly cited in the literature range from ~20% of dogs older than one year up to ~80% of dogs older than eight years in referral-based or radiographic settings (Anderson et al, 2018). 

Cognitive aging: reported prevalence increases with age, with estimates such as ~14% to 35% in dogs over eight years, rising further in very old dogs (Kang et al, 2025). 

These prevalence dynamics matter financially because they expand the pool of animals eligible for long-duration supplementation, and they naturally support premium positioning if claims are credibly evidence-backed.


Consumer compliance in pets is strongly format-driven. In global market sizing, chewable formats are frequently described as the lead delivery system. One commonly cited estimate places chewable and soft chews at ~39% share in 2024, with further growth thereafter (Mordor Intelligence, 2025). 
On category mix, market research estimates often show:

Multivitamins as a large “generalist” segment (for example, ~36% in 2025 in one global estimate) (Mordor Intelligence, 2025). 

Hip and joint formulas as a core “condition-led” category (for example, ~28% in 2025 in the same dataset) (Mordor Intelligence, 2025). 

Dogs dominating consumption (for example, ~77% share in 2025 in that same global estimate) (Mordor Intelligence, 2025). 



III.1.2. Implication for an investment lens

	
The most scalable pet nutraceutical models tend to combine high repeat purchase categories (mobility, gut, calming), high-compliance delivery formats (especially chews), and distribution strategies that reduce friction (e-commerce, subscription, strong retail velocity), while maintaining credibility with veterinarians where possible.

III.2. Horses (equine)

III.2.1. Adoption logic	
Equine nutraceutical demand is typically anchored in performance, musculoskeletal wear, gastric and digestive sensitivity, and competition-related management. Unlike pets, the “buyer” is often a performance-motivated owner or stable manager, and the product must fit established feeding routines (powders, pellets, top-dress) while meeting high expectations for perceived efficacy.

III.2.2. Why equine matters financially despite smaller headcount	
Equine is often a premium niche: a smaller population can still generate meaningful value if average annual spend per animal is high and if products are integrated into stable programmes.

A practical proxy for relevance in the US is that household-level surveys still capture a visible horse-owner footprint (for example, 2 million US households reporting horse ownership in one dataset) (APPA, 2025).

III.3. Livestock

III.3.1. Volume is the core feature of livestock


In production animals, feed-linked delivery unlocks scale. Global feed production is estimated at 1.396 billion metric tons in 2024, up from 1.380 billion metric tons in 2023 (Alltech, 2025). Poultry is the largest feed-consuming segment, accounting for 42.7% of total feed tonnage in the same dataset (Alltech, 2025). 



III.3.2. Why nutraceutical-like additives are pulled into livestock rations

Adoption is tied to three measurable objectives:

Productivity economics: feed conversion ratio (FCR), daily gain, mortality reduction, uniformity.

Health risk management: gut stability around high-risk periods (weaning, heat stress, transport, disease outbreaks).

Regulatory and customer constraints: antimicrobial stewardship and environmental targets.

III.3.3. Regulatory pressure as a demand catalyst (antibiotics and alternatives)	
The economic case for gut-health additives, probiotics, organic acids, enzymes, and other “eubiotic” strategies strengthens when antimicrobial tools are constrained:

A widely cited EU policy target is a 50% reduction in sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and aquaculture by 2030 (European Commission, 2020). 

In the US, 2022 sales were down 36% versus the 2015 peak year for medically important antimicrobials sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals (FDA, 2023). 

Certain historical “crutches” have also been withdrawn; for example, marketing authorisations for veterinary medicines containing zinc oxide were withdrawn in the UK in line with the European decision, effective by 26 June 2022 (VMD, 2022). 

III.3.4. Proof that innovation is being “institutionalised” into the feed additive framework	
A major signal is that novel biological tools are now entering formal authorisation frameworks. For example, the EU authorised a preparation of specific bacteriophages as a feed additive for poultry via Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1390 (European Commission, 2025). 

III.3.5. Macro tailwind: animal protein output continues to rise	
Over the coming decade, the output of meat, dairy products, and eggs is projected to increase by ~17% (OECD-FAO, 2025). This does not automatically translate into additive growth, but it expands the physical throughput where additives can be deployed, especially where they protect performance under tighter constraints.

III.4. Aquaculture

	
Aquaculture is increasingly the growth engine of animal protein supply and is characterised by high biological risk, high density, and large feed-cost sensitivity, which creates a strong economic rationale for functional nutrition strategies (gut modulation, immune resilience, stress management).

In 2022, aquaculture surpassed capture fisheries as the main producer of aquatic animals, with global aquaculture production reaching 130.9 million tonnes, including 94.4 million tonnes of aquatic animals, representing 51% of total aquatic animal production (FAO, 2024). 

Investment implication	
Aquaculture is attractive for “efficacy-led” nutraceutical-like solutions because performance and survival outcomes can be measured at scale, and innovations can be deployed through standardised feed channels.
