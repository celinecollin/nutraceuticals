## II.1. Mobility and Joint Health (Dogs, Horses)

Joint and mobility supplements are among the most popular nutraceuticals in the companion animal sector, accounting for approximately 30–31% of the total pet supplement market due to the high prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) in aging dogs and cats, as well as joint stress in performance horses. These functional ingredients are typically used as adjuncts in multimodal pain management aimed at delaying disease progression and reducing reliance on traditional pharmaceuticals like NSAIDs.

The scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of specific joint nutraceuticals varies widely:

Nutraceutical Consumption in Animal Healthcare – Comprehensive Market Study

Puri, Vivek, et al. "A comprehensive review on nutraceuticals: therapy support and formulation challenges." Nutrients 14.21 (2022): 4637.

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA from fish oil)

These compounds offer the strongest evidence base and consistently demonstrated efficacy for the management of osteoarthritis in dogs and cats. Omega-3s exert potent anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the arachidonic acid pathway, reducing pro-inflammatory molecules like prostaglandin E2, and generating specialized pro-resolving mediators. Clinical trials, often utilizing objective measures like force-plate gait analysis in dogs, have shown that omega-3-enriched diets result in significant pain relief and improved weight bearing. This effect is so pronounced that it often allows for a reduction in the necessary dosage of conventional NSAIDs for dogs with OA (NSAID-sparing effect). Krill oil, a marine source of Omega-3s, is reported to be well tolerated in horses and effectively increases their omega-3 index levels.

Green-lipped mussel extract (Perna canaliculus)

GLM contains a blend of glycosaminoglycans and marine omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA). While some controlled studies in dogs reported modest positive effects on pain and weight-bearing parameters, the body of evidence suffers from inconsistencies across trials, yielding a moderate level of support overall. In cats with OA, GLM supplementation was reported to improve behavior and locomotion.

Undenatured type II collagen (UC-II)

Collagen supplementation generally showed weak efficacy in meta-analyses concerning canine and feline OA pain. However, newer research suggests its mechanism involves inducing oral tolerance to mitigate immune-mediated cartilage deterioration. When UC-II was administered in combination with Boswellia serrata, studies in dogs demonstrated improvements in mobility and metabolic changes in joint fluid.

Guo, Xinzi, et al. "Nutritional strategies for managing joint health in companion animals." Animal Advances 2.1 (2025).





MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) and Hyaluronic acid

These compounds are widely used in commercial joint formulas. MSM functions as a sulfur source important for cartilage metabolism. However, controlled clinical data supporting the efficacy of MSM in managing OA in horses and dogs are generally lacking or insufficient. Similarly, an older systematic review of canine trials found an extremely low level of comfort for intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections as a treatment for OA.

Barbeau-Gregoire, Maude, et al. "A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of enriched therapeutic diets and nutraceuticals in canine and feline osteoarthritis." International Journal of Molecular Sciences 23.18 (2022): 10384.



Boswellia serrata extract

This plant extract contains Boswellic acids, which are powerful anti-inflammatory agents recognized for effectively inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway. Systematic reviews in humans support its efficacy and safety for OA patients. In dogs, supplements containing Boswellia serrata resin extract showed potential to improve clinical conditions associated with osteoarthritis and spinal disease.

Turmeric (curcumin)

Curcuminoids, derived from turmeric, possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While they target inflammatory mediators in joint disease, clinical evidence of efficacy in companion animals remains preliminary. Curcumin is commonly included in composite nutraceutical diets, and a combination with hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract was found to reduce pain severity in dogs.

Funk, Janet L., et al. "Efficacy and mechanism of action of turmeric supplements in the treatment of experimental arthritis." Arthritis & Rheumatism: Official Journal of the American College of Rheumatology 54.11 (2006): 3452-3464



Glucosamine and chondroitin 

Despite being market mainstays and highly popular among pet owners, recent high-level scientific reviews indicate a marked non-effect of the glucosamine–chondroitin combination for pain management in canine and feline OA. These meta-analyses explicitly recommended that these products should no longer be routinely recommended for pain control in this context. In horses, available research on G/C supplements generally suggests limited efficacy or is constrained by methodological flaws and concerns regarding their very low oral bioavailability (e.g., as low as 0%–5.9% in horses for glucosamine).

## II.2. Gut Health and Microbiome Modulation (Livestock, Aquaculture, Dogs, Cats):





Gut health management is a primary focus of modern animal nutrition, aiming to achieve eubiosis (microbial balance) to enhance immunity and productivity. This sector has expanded rapidly as a response to global mandates to reduce antimicrobial usage on farms.

Lee, Anne H., et al. "Dietary supplementation with fiber,“biotics,” and spray-dried plasma affects apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility and the fecal characteristics, fecal microbiota, and immune function of adult dogs." Journal of animal science 100.3 (2022): skac048.

Probiotics: Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bifidobacterium spp

These live microorganisms, including Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, and Bifidobacterium spp., improve the intestinal profile through the competitive exclusion of pathogens. In companion animals, multi-strain probiotics are clinically validated to resolve acute diarrhoea significantly faster than placebos or traditional metronidazole.



Shmalberg, Justin, et al. "A randomized double blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of a probiotic or metronidazole for acute canine diarrhea." Frontiers in veterinary science 6 (2019): 163.

Prebiotics: FOS, MOS, inulin, chicory root

Indigestible carbohydrates such as FOS, MOS, inulin, and chicory root selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria. Their fermentation in the hindgut produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which serves as a vital energy source for intestinal cells and reinforces the gut barrier.



Shmalberg, Justin, et al. "A randomized double blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of a probiotic or metronidazole for acute canine diarrhea." Frontiers in veterinary science 6 (2019): 163.



Postbiotics: inactivated microbial metabolites (e.g. butyrate producers, heat-treated Lactobacillus)

This emerging category consists of inactivated microbial cells or metabolites, such as heat-treated Lactobacillus or butyrate producers. They are increasingly preferred in industrial livestock production because they remain stable during high-heat feed processing (pelleting/extrusion), where live probiotics often perish.

Organic acids: formic, lactic, fumaric, citric acids

Blends of formic, lactic, fumaric, and citric acids are used in livestock to lower gastrointestinal pH, which inhibits pathogen proliferation and improves nutrient solubility. Their application is associated with a 3–8% improvement in Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) in monogastric animals.

Digestive enzymes: amylase, protease, phytase

Biological catalysts like amylase, protease, and phytase break down anti-nutritional factors in plant-based feeds to improve digestibility. Phytase is specifically critical for environmental sustainability, as it unlocks plant-bound phosphorus, reducing its excretion by 27–45% and mitigating soil and water pollution

Abdelli, Nedra, David Solà-Oriol, and José Francisco Pérez. "Phytogenic feed additives in poultry: achievements, prospective and challenges." Animals 11.12 (2021): 3471.

Clay binders and toxin adsorbents

Materials such as bentonite, zeolite, and illite are incorporated into feed to sequester mycotoxins and heavy metals. These binders prevent toxins from being absorbed through the intestinal epithelium, protecting the animal from sub-clinical toxicity.

Phibro Animal Health Corporation

Herbal gut soothers: slippery elm, marshmallow root

Botanicals such as slippery elm and marshmallow root are utilized for their mucosal-protective and anti-inflammatory properties. These phytogenics stimulate endogenous digestive secretions and can match the performance effects of antibiotic growth promoters in intensive systems.

Nicotra, Mario, Tommaso Iannitti, and Alessandro Di Cerbo. "Nutraceuticals, Social Interaction, and Psychophysiological Influence on Pet Health and Well-Being: Focus on Dogs and Cats." Veterinary Sciences 12.10 (2025): 964.

Synbiotics (combinations of pro- and prebiotics)

These are synergistic combinations of probiotics and prebiotics designed to enhance the survival and colonisation of beneficial microbes. Synbiotics have shown high efficacy in shelter environments, where they significantly reduce the incidence of stress-induced diarrhoea in dogs.

Rose, L., et al. "Efficacy of a probiotic‐prebiotic supplement on incidence of diarrhea in a dog shelter: a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial." Journal of veterinary internal medicine 31.2 (2017): 377-382.

## II.3. Immunity and Resilience (Aquaculture, Poultry, Swine):

The field of immunity and resilience in aquaculture, poultry, and swine is heavily reliant on nutraceuticals as alternatives to traditional antibiotics, especially following global restrictions on Antimicrobial Growth Promoters (AGPs). These species, particularly poultry and swine (monogastrics), have demonstrated the fastest adoption of such alternatives due to their rapid production cycles and the high economic risks associated with disease outbreaks. Functional ingredients act primarily by modulating the gut-microbiome axis, enhancing barrier function, and bolstering the host’s non-specific (innate) immune system.

Ibeagha-Awemu, Eveline M., et al. "Alternatives to antibiotics for sustainable livestock production in the context of the One-Health-Approach: Tackling a common foe." Frontiers in Veterinary Science 12 (2025): 1605215.

Atuahene, David, et al. "Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Pigs and Poultry: A Review of Gut Health, Performance, and Environmental Outcomes." Veterinary Sciences 12.11 (2025): 1054.

Beta-1,3/1,6-Glucans (Yeast Derivatives) and Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS): 

Beta-glucans (-glucans) are polysaccharide components derived from yeast cell walls or fungal sources, categorized as prebiotics. They are highly valued as immunostimulants in aquaculture, poultry, and swine.  

Mechanism: They primarily function by binding to specific receptors (like Dectin-1) on immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, thereby activating an inflammatory response and enhancing phagocytosis and oxidative burst capacities. This "primes" the immune system for a quicker, more effective response against infections.

Applications: In aquaculture (shrimp), -glucans are critical, boosting innate immunity and resulting in higher survival rates against bacterial and viral challenges because shrimp lack an adaptive immune system. In poultry and swine, -glucans reduce the shedding of pathogens like Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella, contributing to gut health and improved feed conversion efficiency. They are often used with vitamin C in calves to mitigate transport stress



Ballou, Michael A., Emily M. Davis, and Benjamin A. Kasl. "Nutraceuticals: an alternative strategy for the use of antimicrobials." The Veterinary clinics of North America. Food animal practice 35.3 (2019): 507.



Colostrum and immunoglobulin-rich plasma fractions

Colostrum (the first milk produced by mammals) and passive immunization using hyperimmune plasma or egg yolk antibodies (IgY) are non-antibiotic strategies for enhancing immune defenses, particularly in neonates.

Mechanism: Colostrum provides passive immunity to neonates via high levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies), protecting them from pathogens during the first week of life. Plasma and whey derived from slaughterhouses contain natural immunoglobulins (IgG) that have demonstrated antibacterial effects against swine pathogens like E. coli and Salmonella enterica.

Applications: Bovine colostrum supplementation in piglets improves gut integrity, growth performance, and sanitary status. In challenged piglets, colostrum significantly modulated cytokine production, reducing the inflammatory response compared to antibiotic-fed controls.

Ibeagha-Awemu, Eveline M., et al. "Alternatives to antibiotics for sustainable livestock production in the context of the One-Health-Approach: Tackling a common foe." Frontiers in Veterinary Science 12 (2025): 1605215.

Lo Verso, Luca, et al. "The combination of nutraceuticals and functional feeds as additives modulates gut microbiota and blood markers associated with immune response and health in weanling piglets." Journal of animal science 98.8 (2020): skaa208.



Seaweed  (Ascophyllum nodosum, brown algae)

Algae and seaweed are increasingly integrated into feed due to their nutritional and functional content.

Composition: Brown seaweed like Ascophyllum nodosum is rich in antioxidants and polysaccharides (such as alginic acid, fucoidan, and laminarin).

Applications: In poultry, seaweed meal enhances gut integrity, anti-inflammatory response, and overall health. When microencapsulated with essential oils (EOs), seaweed was shown to improve feed conversion ratio and reduce mortality in broilers. In aquaculture, algae-derived compounds often provide the most favorable improvements in survival and immune indices.

Elolimy, Ahmed A., et al. "Effects of microencapsulated essential oils and seaweed meal on growth performance, digestive enzymes, intestinal morphology, liver functions, and plasma biomarkers in broiler chickens." Journal of Animal Science 103 (2025): skaf092.

Echinacea, astragalus extracts

These are popular botanicals used for their purported immune-modulating properties.

Echinacea contains polysaccharides, caffeic acid derivatives, and alkamides, which mediate its immunostimulatory effects, primarily through the activation of phagocytosis, macrophages, and NK cells. In dogs, studies suggested Echinacea extract significantly increased white blood cell counts and IgM levels.

Astragalus root (Astragalus membranaceus) is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and contains polysaccharides and saponins, which enhance the activities of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Astragalus polysaccharides significantly improved wound healing and immune response markers in castrated beagle dogs.

Guo, Xinzi, et al. "The role of plant extracts in enhancing nutrition and health for dogs and cats: Safety, benefits, and applications." Veterinary Sciences 11.9 (2024): 426.



Selenium, vitamin E (antioxidants) and Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)

Vitamins and trace minerals are essential for immune function, and often applied at supra-nutritional levels to promote resilience

Antioxidant Role: Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and Selenium are crucial components of the antioxidant system (as cofactors for glutathione peroxidase, GPx). They protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress—damage caused by excessive free radicals—which is exacerbated during stress or infection. Supplementation in poultry improves antioxidant capacity in meat and elevates GPx activity in serum and tissues. In dairy cows, extra Vitamin E and Selenium reduced the incidence of mastitis and retained placenta.

Vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant that aids immune function by reducing oxidative stress and supporting the regeneration of Vitamin E. It is commonly used in poultry and swine drinking water as a rapid response tool, as animals often stop eating but continue drinking when subjected to stress (e.g., heat stress).

Atuahene, David, et al. "Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Pigs and Poultry: A Review of Gut Health, Performance, and Environmental Outcomes." Veterinary Sciences 12.11 (2025): 1054.

Nucleotides (from yeast hydrolysates)

Nucleotides are low-molecular-weight organic compounds used as immunostimulants.

Applications: They have been shown to improve survival rates and overall health in fish and shrimp. In cats, yeast-derived nucleotides, combined with other supplements, improved immune system functionality, evidenced by enhanced lymphocyte proliferative responses.

Nicotra, Mario, Tommaso Iannitti, and Alessandro Di Cerbo. "Nutraceuticals, Social Interaction, and Psychophysiological Influence on Pet Health and Well-Being: Focus on Dogs and Cats." Veterinary Sciences 12.10 (2025): 964.

Functional peptides (lactoferrin)

Peptide derivatives play a critical role in antimicrobial defense and immune regulation.

• Lactoferrin is a globular glycoprotein found in milk and secretions, functioning as an innate defense agent with antimicrobial activity. It has been shown to enhance immune response and protective effects against bacterial infections in fish.

• Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) are small, positively charged proteins (like microcin J25) that rapidly kill pathogens by penetrating bacterial membranes. Supplementation in broilers reduced inflammation and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

## II.4. Cognitive Support and Aging (Senior Dogs/Cats)



The market for cognitive support and healthy aging in companion animals is expanding rapidly, driven by an aging pet population and the prevalence of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS), which affects approximately 14–35% of senior dogs. Nutritional interventions aim to extend the healthspan—the period of functional independence and quality of life—by targeting age-associated mechanisms like oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation.

MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides)

Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) MCTs are strongly supported as a primary nutritional strategy for cognitive decline, often serving as an alternative energy source for the brain.



Mechanism and Efficacy: The aging brain often experiences reduced glucose metabolism. MCTs are rapidly converted by the liver into ketone bodies (-hydroxybutyrate, BHB), which neurons can utilize as an alternative fuel source, thereby alleviating deficits in glucose metabolism.



Clinical Results (Dogs): Dietary supplementation with MCTs has been shown to yield long-lasting cognition-enhancing effects in aged dogs. Studies demonstrated that an MCT diet significantly improved spatial learning, memory, and executive functions in healthy old dogs within just one month of feeding. The systemic metabolic impact of MCT feeding includes increased levels of circulating ketone bodies and alterations in complex lipids and amino acid profiles in the serum.





Pan, Yuanlong, et al. "Effects of Dietary Medium-Chain Triglyceride Supplementation on the Serum Metabolome of Young Adult and Senior Canines." Animals 14.24 (2024): 3577

Phosphatidylserine

This phospholipid is a critical component of cellular membranes. It has been utilized in supplements (often alongside Ginkgo biloba, vitamin E, and B6) shown to improve short-term memory performance in aged beagles. 

Araujo, Joseph A., et al. "Improvement of short-term memory performance in aged beagles by a nutraceutical supplement containing phosphatidylserine, Ginkgo biloba, vitamin E, and pyridoxine." The Canadian Veterinary Journal 49.4 (2008): 379.

DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)

As an omega-3 fatty acid, DHA is essential for synaptogenesis and neuronal development. In aging pets, DHA exerts protective effects against oxidative stress and inflammation, enhancing neurogenesis and glucose transporter activity. It is considered a "gold standard" for anti-inflammatory support in geriatric patients

Brown, Scott A., et al. "Effects of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in early renal insufficiency in dogs." Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine 135.3 (2000): 275-286.

Antioxidant blends: Vitamin C, E, lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10

Antioxidants are crucial components of geriatric diets as they help manage age-related oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, key drivers of cognitive decline



Antioxidant Vitamins (C & E): Vitamins C and E are essential for antioxidant defense, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Dietary enrichment with antioxidants (including Vitamin E and C) and mitochondrial cofactors has been consistently shown to reduce Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) and improve cognitive test performance and daily activity in old dogs. Vitamin E, in particular, is the only lipid-soluble chain-breaking antioxidant in plasma.



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): CoQ10 (Ubiquinone) is a naturally occurring compound that aids in carbohydrate metabolism and acts as an antioxidant. Studies in dogs with Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) found that depleted myocardial CoQ10 concentrations are associated with CHF. Supplementation with CoQ10 in stage C MMVD dogs improved systolic function (fractional shortening and ejection fraction) and had a positive impact on inflammatory markers in groups C and D, indicating it may decrease inflammation in dogs with CHF.



Lipoic Acid: Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) is commonly cited for its antioxidant and mitochondrial cofactor properties, often supplemented alongside L-Carnitine and Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR). The combination of ALCAR and LA has demonstrated improved cognitive outcomes, particularly in memory, in two out of three trials testing this pairing alone. However, care must be taken with -lipoic acid dosing, as low doses can be toxic to cats and should generally be avoided.

SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine)

Liver Support and Cognitive Use: SAMe restores glutathione (GSH) reserves in the liver, which reduces liver damage due to its antioxidant capacity. Reduced GSH concentration is correlated with illness severity and increased mortality in dogs and cats, and low GSH values are found in pets with liver diseases. SAMe is commonly used to treat liver disease and cognitive dysfunction in dogs and is often combined with Silybin/Milk Thistle for enhanced hepatoprotection. In one trial, SAMe supplementation reduced the oxidative stress likely caused by steroids, helping maintain the total GSH concentration in erythrocytes. However, a non-effect was detected for S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAMe) in one set of "other products" trials.

Reichling, J., et al. "Reduction of behavioural disturbances in elderly dogs supplemented with a standardised Ginkgo leaf extract." Schweizer Archiv für Tierheilkunde 148.5 (2006): 257-263.

Ginkgo biloba (limited veterinary data)

Extracts from Ginkgo biloba are studied for their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. In aged dogs, it has been shown to ameliorate clinical signs of cognitive impairment, such as disorientation and sleep disturbances, though specific veterinary data remains limited compared to human data.

B-complex vitamins

These act as essential cofactors in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Thiamine (B1) is particularly critical for neurological health; deficiencies—which can occur in anorexic cats or pets on inadequate diets—lead to severe neurological dysfunction.

## II.5. Calming and Behavioral Wellness (Dogs, Cats, Horses):

The market for calming and behavioural wellness is one of the fastest-growing segments in companion animal healthcare, projected to rise at a 9.7% CAGR as pet owners increasingly seek solutions for separation anxiety, noise phobias, and situational stress. These products occupy a critical adjunct role in multimodal behavioural management; while they may effectively "take the edge off" mild to moderate anxiety, they are generally not considered replacements for prescription psychotropics in severe clinical cases.



L-theanine (from green tea)

An amino acid structurally similar to glutamic acid, it increases levels of GABA, serotonin, and dopamine in the brain. Clinical evidence for L-theanine is robust; a pure isomer form (99.95%) has been shown to significantly reduce global anxiety scores in storm-sensitive dogs, diminishing behaviours such as drooling (83% success), panting (76%), and hiding (78%), with a 94% owner satisfaction rate.

Pike, Amy L., Debra F. Horwitz, and Heidi Lobprise. "An open-label prospective study of the use of l-theanine (Anxitane) in storm-sensitive client-owned dogs." Journal of Veterinary Behavior 10.4 (2015): 324-331.

Alpha-casozepine (milk protein derivative)

Often sold under the brand Zylkene®, this casein hydrolysate has GABAergic calming properties. It has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxious behaviours in both cats and dogs during stressful events, particularly when used as part of a "calm" diet in synergy with L-tryptophan.

Landsberg, Gary, et al. "Therapeutic effects of an alpha-casozepine and L-tryptophan supplemented diet on fear and anxiety in the cat." Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 19.6 (2017): 594-602.

Schroers, M., et al. "Effect of casozepine administration on stress in dogs during a veterinary examination–A randomized placebo-controlled trial." The Veterinary Journal 306 (2024): 106148.

Tryptophan

As a precursor to serotonin, dietary supplementation with tryptophan has been shown to lower territorial and dominance aggression scores in dogs. In intensive farming, it is used to reduce fighting and skin lesions in weaned pigs, while in horses, it is a common ingredient in "calmers" for transport and competition.

Sechi, S., et al. "Effects in dogs with behavioural disorders of a commercial nutraceutical diet on stress and neuroendocrine parameters." Veterinary Record 180.1 (2017): 18-18

Magnesium and B-vitamins

Magnesium functions as a natural sedative at supra-nutritional levels and is frequently administered to horses and pigs to mitigate transport-induced cortisol elevation. B-vitamins, specifically Thiamine (B1), are essential for proper neurological function and are core components of many multi-nutrient calming complexes.

Herbal botanicals (Valerian root, passionflower, chamomile)

These are traditional staples with a long history of use for nervous tension; however, rigorous veterinary trials are sparse. One controlled study on dogs found that valerian root diffusers had no discernible effect on stress behaviours in unfamiliar environments, highlighting the inconsistency of some herbal modalities.

Taylor, Sienna, and Joah Madden. "The effect of pet remedy on the behaviour of the domestic dog (Canis familiaris)." Animals 6.11 (2016): 64.

CBD (limited veterinary regulation)

A non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid that interacts with the endocannabinoid system to regulate inflammatory and nociceptive signals. While highly popular and promising for both anxiety and osteoarthritis pain, its use remains constrained by a lack of harmonized veterinary regulation and the need for more long-term safety data regarding its impact on liver enzymes like alkaline phosphatase.

Burstein, Sumner. "Cannabidiol (CBD) and its analogs: a review of their effects on inflammation." Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry 23.7 (2015): 1377-1385.

Herbal calming complexes (e.g. magnolia + phellodendron)

Modern formulations often combine multiple bioactives, such as L-theanine with Magnolia and Phellodendron (Solliquin®), to target the multifaceted pathways of the stress response through a synergistic approach.



## II.6.Performance, FCR, and Growth (Livestock, Aquaculture)



The industrial livestock and aquaculture sectors are governed by a rigorous cost-per-tonne economic logic, where the primary measure of efficacy is the improvement of the Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR). In this high-volume environment, nutraceuticals and specialty feed additives have transitioned from optional enhancements to essential components of the animal health value chain, particularly as validated alternatives to Antibiotic Growth Promoters (AGPs).

The Future of Animal Health: Strategic Lessons from Human Healthcare - L.E.K. Consulting, https://www.lek.com/insights/hea/eu/ei/future-animal-health-strategic-lessons-human-healthcare



Enzyme complexes (xylanase, cellulase, phytase)

These biological catalysts speed up chemical reactions to break down anti-nutritional factors like non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) and phytic acid. Xylanase and -glucanase reduce digesta viscosity to improve nutrient uptake, while phytase unlocks phosphorus from plant materials, leading to a 27–45% reduction in phosphorus excretion.

Organic trace minerals (chelated Zn, Cu, Mn)

Chelation technology provides superior bioavailability by protecting minerals from antagonistic interactions in the gut, ensuring maximum absorption and minimised environmental impact. Specifically, zinc plays an essential role in cell proliferation and immune defense, while zinc picolinate has been shown to decrease oxidative stress in species like rainbow trout.

Phytogenics (essential oils: thymol, cinnamaldehyde, garlic, oregano)

As the fastest-growing category, these plant-derived bioactive compounds possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that stimulate digestive secretions and modulate gut flora. Blends of thymol and carvacrol (from thyme and oregano) can improve weight gain by approximately 13% and enhance FCR in broilers from 1.71 to 1.60.

## II.8. Nutraceuticals for the control of ticks, fleas and other ectoparasites ?



Nutraceuticals for the control of ectoparasites such as ticks, fleas and flies represent a niche but growing segment of the market, primarily serving as natural repellents or life-cycle disruptors. While potent, modern parasiticides like isoxazolines or neonicotinoids (e.g. nitenpyram) WSAVA_List_of_Essential_Medicines_for_Cats_and_Dogs_final. are federally regulated as veterinary drugs or pesticides, the nutraceutical sector focuses on phytogenic additives and oral delivery formats that bolster the animal's natural resistance or target parasites in the environment.



Regulatory Context and Oversight

 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) generally maintains jurisdiction over products applied topically to animals or premises to control external parasites. However, when these substances are administered orally through feed or supplements, they may fall under the oversight of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) or remain in a "grey area" depending on the claims made.

Phibro Animal Health Corporation, 2023



Livestock and Aquaculture Applications In intensive farming, control is often achieved through feed-integrated formats that target parasites at the larval stage:



• Oral Larvicides: Compounds like tetraclorvinphos (Rabon) are fed to cattle via rations or minerals; the substance passes through the digestive tract to kill fly larvae as they hatch in the manure.



• Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs): Substances such as S-methoprene (Altosid IGR) and diflubenzuron (JustiFly) are used as feed additives to disrupt the life cycles of horn, face, and stable flies.



• Phytogenics as Repellents: The sources explicitly classify phytogenic feed additives—plant-derived compounds—as insect repellents based on their application characteristics.



https://extension.msstate.edu/publications/feed-additives-for-beef-cattle-diets





Phytogenic Bioactives and Mechanisms Functional ingredients derived from plants leverage specific secondary metabolites to deter or inhibit ectoparasites:

Finno, Carrie J. "Veterinary pet supplements and nutraceuticals." Nutrition today 55.2 (2020): 97-101.



• Garlic and B-Vitamins: Garlic (Allium sativum) is frequently touted for its ability to reduce the risk of parasitic infestation and stimulate the immune system. Commercial examples include oral anti-mosquito preparations for animals composed of a blend of B vitamins, garlic, Echinacea, and curcumin.



• Quinones: Specific subclasses like naphthoquinones and anthraquinones (e.g. emodin, rhein) are documented to possess anti-parasitic and anti-microbial properties, with ongoing research into their utility as functional ingredients.

Jagtap, Ashok S., and Cathrine S. Manohar. "Overview on microbial enzymatic production of algal oligosaccharides for nutraceutical applications." Marine Biotechnology 23.2 (2021): 159-176.



• Essential Oils: Volatile lipophilic substances, such as those derived from thyme, oregano, and cloves, are increasingly used for their anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory effects. For instance, thymol has been shown to assist in battling various parasitic diseases in veterinary medicine.

Vijayaram, Seerengaraj, et al. "Bioactive immunostimulants as health-promoting feed additives in aquaculture: A review." Fish & Shellfish Immunology 130 (2022): 294-308.

Robinson, Narda Gail. "Exploring plant-based therapies in veterinary medicine." Frontiers in Veterinary Science 12 (2025): 1719496.



Strategic Importance and Limitations The push for "antibiotic-free" and drug-free animal production is a primary driver for these natural alternatives. However, the sources note significant caveats:



• Incomplete Control: Oral larvicides, while effective against larvae in manure, do not control migrating adult flies from neighbouring premises, necessitating a multimodal management approach.

https://extension.msstate.edu/publications/feed-additives-for-beef-cattle-diets



• Lack of Evidence: For many popular pet repellents (e.g. herbal blends), there is a paucity of robust clinical data compared to conventional pharmaceuticals, leading experts to recommend them primarily as adjuncts rather than standalone treatments.





• Toxicity Risks: Natural origin does not guarantee safety; for example, excessive garlic intake can lead to hemolytic anemia in dogs, cats, and horses.



Using these nutraceuticals for parasite control is like planting a defensive hedge around a property: while it creates a natural barrier that deters intruders and reduces their numbers, it may not be as impenetrable as a high-security electronic fence (pharmaceutical drugs), especially during a full-scale invasion.





II.9. Nutraceuticals for the control of other diseases 



Veterinary nutraceuticals offer a sophisticated range of preventive health benefits by moving beyond basic nutrition to actively modulate an animal's internal biology, gene expression, and immune resilience Exploring the role of nutraceuticals in enhancing animal nutrition, International Journal of Research in Agronomy 2024; SP-7(9): 702-709.. Their primary value in disease prevention lies in their ability to function as primitive signals that turn on specific metabolic pathways to maintain eubiosis (microbial balance) and resolve systemic inflammation quickly. Asmelash, B., D. Mahlet, and H. Brhane. "Livestock nutrigenomics applications and prospects." J. Vet. Sci. Technol 9.01 (2018).



Benefits of Nutraceuticals in Disease Prevention

• Nutrigenomic Regulation: Through "nutrigenomics," nutrients act as external factors that regulate transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics Asmelash, B., D. Mahlet, and H. Brhane. "Livestock nutrigenomics applications and prospects." J. Vet. Sci. Technol 9.01 (2018).. This allows for "fine-tuning" genes involved in disease resistance and turning off stress-response genes, which maintains the animal's healthy status. Aminullah, Noor, et al. "Phytogenic feed additives as alternatives to antibiotics in poultry production: A review." Veterinary World 18.1 (2025): 141.



• Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Defence: Bioactive compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and Vitamin E stimulate the Nrf2-ARE pathway, upregulating endogenous antioxidant enzymes to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). This mitigates "secret killers" like chronic intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress, which are associated with 90% of pathological disorders in poultry.



ul Haq, Zulfqar, et al. "Nutrigenomics in livestock sector and its human-animal interface-a review." Veterinary and Animal Science 17 (2022): 100262.



• Toxicity and Mycotoxin Mitigation: Specific nutraceuticals can decrease the deleterious effects of heavy metals (such as lead), pesticides, and mycotoxins. For example, curcumin has been shown to reverse liver injury and alterations in serum biochemical parameters induced by aflatoxin B1.



Aminullah, Noor, et al. "Phytogenic feed additives as alternatives to antibiotics in poultry production: A review." Veterinary World 18.1 (2025): 141.



• Improved Product Integrity: In livestock, nutraceuticals improve food safety and carcass quality by reducing chemical contaminants like ammonia and endotoxins in the digestive tract.

Mechanisms to Avoid Disease Spreading



Nutraceuticals help hinder the spread of infections within a population by reducing the pathogen burden and limiting environmental contamination through several "host-centric" mechanisms:

Atuahene, David, et al. "Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Pigs and Poultry: A Review of Gut Health, Performance, and Environmental Outcomes." Veterinary Sciences 12.11 (2025): 1054.



• Competitive Exclusion: Probiotics (e.g., Lactobacillus and Bacillus subtilis) outcompete pathogens like Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens for adhesion sites and nutrients on the gut wall.



Idowu, Peter Ayodeji, Lwando Mbambalala, and Adeola Patience Idowu. "Probiotics as sustainable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters: Mechanisms, applications, and future perspectives in livestock production: Livestock health and productivity in the post-antibiotic era." Letters In Animal Biology 5.1 (2025): 129-142.



• Binding and Inactivation: Prebiotics like mannanoligosaccharides (MOS) contain mannose-specific filaments that bind to the type 1 fimbriae of Gram-negative bacteria, preventing them from attaching to the epithelium and colonising the gastrointestinal tract.

Ballou, Michael A., Emily M. Davis, and Benjamin A. Kasl. "Nutraceuticals: an alternative strategy for the use of antimicrobials." The Veterinary clinics of North America. Food animal practice 35.3 (2019): 507.





• Barrier Reinforcement: Postbiotics and phytogenics strengthen tight junction proteins (such as occludin and ZO-1) and increase mucin secretion, which prevents pathogens from entering the bloodstream (leaky gut syndrome).

Atuahene, David, et al. "Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Pigs and Poultry: A Review of Gut Health, Performance, and Environmental Outcomes." Veterinary Sciences 12.11 (2025): 1054.



• Reduced Shedding: Supplementation has been clinically proven to reduce the fecal shedding of infectious agents, which directly slows the transmission of pathogens into the immediate farm environment or between household pets.

"Probiotics as sustainable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters: Mechanisms, applications, and future perspectives in livestock production: Livestock health and productivity in the post-antibiotic era." Letters In Animal Biology 5.1 (2025): 129-142.





Target Diseases and Pathogens



Nutraceuticals have demonstrated efficacy in mitigating the spread and impact of the following conditions:



• Bacterial: Salmonellosis, Colibacillosis, Necrotic Enteritis, Vibriosis (in aquaculture), and Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Atuahene, David, et al. "Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Pigs and Poultry: A Review of Gut Health, Performance, and Environmental Outcomes." Veterinary Sciences 12.11 (2025): 1054.



• Viral: White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) in shrimp, Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD), and Newcastle Disease.

Phibro Animal Health Corporation 2023



• Parasitic: Coccidiosis (Eimeria spp.), Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, and internal parasites like Haemonchus contortus.

Relationship with Vaccination



The sources confirm that while nutraceuticals are powerful preventive tools, they are not a total substitute for core vaccines in most species. Instead, they play a critical complementary and synergistic role:

Anpario-Annual-Report-2022.pdf



Improved Vaccine Response: Compounds like -glucans, L-theanine, and specific vitamins improve vaccine efficacy by increasing specific antibody titers (IgG, IgM, IgA) and enhancing lymphocyte proliferation.

Phibro Animal Health Corporation 2023



Vaccine Adjuvants: Many nutraceutical components, such as saponins and polysaccharides, are used as adjuvants within vaccine formulations to stimulate a more robust innate immune response.

Phibro Animal Health Corporation 2025



Mitigating Vaccine Stress: Phytogenics (essential oils) can alleviate the growth depression and stress sometimes associated with coccidiosis vaccination in poultry.

Fontana, Liliana Berté, et al. "Encapsulation of Zootechnical Additives for Poultry and Swine Feeding: A Systematic Review." ACS omega 10.7 (2025): 6294-6305.



4. Species Exception (Shrimp): Because shrimp and other crustaceans lack an adaptive immune system (no antibodies), vaccines are ineffective. In these cases, the industry relies entirely on nutraceutical immunostimulants as the primary method to boost innate immunity against viral outbreaks.

In essence, using nutraceuticals for disease control is like bolstering a building's internal security staff; while they cannot replace the master security updates provided by vaccines, they ensure the daily "biological machinery" is resilient enough to handle local intrusions before they become a widespread breach.

II.8. Nutraceuticals for the Control of Ticks, Fleas, and Other Ectoparasites



Nutraceutical approaches to ectoparasite control primarily function as natural repellents or life-cycle disruptors, serving as adjuncts to regulated veterinary pharmaceuticals like isoxazolines or neonicotinoids List of Essential Medicines for Cats and Dogs Version 1; January 20th, 2020 Members of the WSAVA Therapeutic Guidelines Group (TGG),. While traditional drugs require formal FDA approval for therapeutic claims, the nutraceutical segment utilizes phytogenic bioactives such as garlic (Allium sativum), rosemary, and thyme to deter infestation Robinson, Narda Gail. "Exploring plant-based therapies in veterinary medicine." Frontiers in Veterinary Science 12 (2025): 1719496. Specific active principles like thymol and eugenol possess documented antimicrobial and antiparasitic properties, often included in oral preparations alongside B-complex vitamins to modulate the animal’s attractiveness to pests Singh, Jagtar, and Shweta Sinha. "Classification, regulatory acts and applications of nutraceuticals for health." International Journal of Pharma and Bio Sciences 2.1 (2012): 177-187. In industrial livestock production, control is integrated into feed via insect growth regulators (IGRs) like S-methoprene or diflubenzuron, which disrupt larval development in manure. Furthermore, specific plant secondary metabolites like quinones (e.g. emodin, rhein) and tannins are being investigated for their ability to inhibit parasite survival and disrupt biofilm formation. Despite their popularity, these natural alternatives often lack the robust clinical data of conventional drugs, and safety is a critical concern; for example, excessive garlic intake can induce hemolytic anemia and the formation of Heinz bodies in dogs, cats, and horses https://extension.msstate.edu/publications/feed-additives-for-beef-cattle-diets, Finno, Carrie J. "Veterinary pet supplements and nutraceuticals." Nutrition today 55.2 (2020): 97-101.. Consequently, these products are positioned as defensive adjuncts rather than standalone treatments, particularly in "drug-free" or organic production systems. Jia, Dan, et al. "Antibacterial Activity of Traditional Medicinal Plants: Combating Antibiotics Resistance in Animal Wound Infections." Veterinary Medicine and Science 11.3 (2025): e70361.



II.9. New Formulations and Administration Systems



The efficacy of veterinary nutraceuticals is increasingly dependent on advanced delivery technologies designed to overcome poor aqueous solubility, volatility, and gastric degradation Yang, Xin, et al. "Advanced Oral Delivery Systems for Nutraceuticals." Advanced Healthcare Materials (2025): 2500271. Soft chews have emerged as the dominant format for companion animals, commanding a 35–39% share of the pet supplement market (and up to 70% of revenue in some segments) due to their high palatability and "treat-like" nature. For industrial livestock, premixes remain the standard, constituting 0.5% to 4% of final feed while providing 100% of micro-nutrition. 

Emerging formulation trends include:

• Microencapsulation: Using biopolymer or lipid matrices to protect sensitive actives like essential oils or probiotics, ensuring targeted release in the small intestine and preventing early absorption in the stomach. Bosetti, Gilnei E., et al. "Microencapsulated carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde replace growth-promoting antibiotics: Effect on performance and meat quality in broiler chickens." Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências 92.3 (2020): e20200343.   “Identifying research gaps and opportunities to enhance sustainable beef production” Gilreath et al 2024 

• Nanotechnology: Utilizing nanoparticles (0–1,000 nm) and nanoemulsions to enhance bioavailability; for instance, nano-encapsulated garlic oil has shown antimicrobial effects 8 times stronger than free-form oil. 

Fontana, Liliana Berté, et al. "Encapsulation of Zootechnical Additives for Poultry and Swine Feeding: A Systematic Review." ACS omega 10.7 (2025): 6294-6305.



• Lipid Carriers (Phytosomes): Complexing botanical extracts with phospholipids, such as the Silybin-Phosphatidylcholine Complex, which increases bioavailability 3 to 4 times compared to standard extracts in dogs.

Filburn, C. R., R. Kettenacker, and D. W. Griffin. "Bioavailability of a silybin–phosphatidylcholine complex in dogs." Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics 30.2 (2007): 132-138.



• Precision and Personalization: Technologies like 3D food printing and AI-integrated nutrition allow for the layer-by-layer construction of customized supplements tailored to an animal's genetic profile or specific life stage.

Yang, Xin, et al. "Advanced Oral Delivery Systems for Nutraceuticals." Advanced Healthcare Materials (2025): 2500271.



• Stability Enhancements: Sprinkle It Technology (SIT) uses multi-layered granules to ensure stable delivery of micronutrients for aging patients.

II.10. The “Green Claim”: Nutraceuticals to Help Reduce Environmental Impact



Nutraceuticals are now central to the "climate-smart" livestock movement, offering quantifiable solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of animal agriculture. The primary environmental targets are enteric methane () from ruminants and nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) excretion in monogastric waste. 



Bruns, M. A. "Ruminant methanogens as a climate change target." American Society for Microbiology. Department of Ecosystem Science and Management at The Pennsylvania State University and a member of ASM's Climate Change Task Force (2023).









Key quantitative impacts include:



• Methane Mitigation: The feed additive 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) reduces enteric methane by an average of 30%, while the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis has demonstrated up to 99% inhibition in vitro. Additionally, yeast probiotics like S. cerevisiae can lower methane production by 10–20% and have been modeled to reduce the total carbon footprint of milk production by 2.9–5%.

Atuahene, David, et al. "Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Pigs and Poultry: A Review of Gut Health, Performance, and Environmental Outcomes." Veterinary Sciences 12.11 (2025): 1054.



• Phosphate Reduction: The global standard application of phytase enzymes breaks down phytic acid to unlock plant-bound phosphorus, resulting in a 27–45% reduction in phosphorus excretion in poultry and swine. 

Rahman, M. R. T., I. Fliss, and E. Biron. "Insights in the development and uses of alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in poultry and swine production. Antibiotics 2022; 11: 766." 2022,



• Nitrogen Efficiency: Precision amino acid supplementation and precision nutrition strategies can reduce nutrient oversupply, leading to an estimated 15–25% reduction in nitrogen excretion and a 20–35% reduction in phosphorus excretion compared to traditional regimes.

Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E., et al. "Effect of forage Moringa oleifera L.(moringa) on animal health and nutrition and its beneficial applications in soil, plants and water purification." Agriculture 8.9 (2018): 145.



• Sustainable Sourcing: The industry is pivoting toward algae-based Omega-3s (DHA/EPA) to maintain nutritional quality in farmed fish while reducing reliance on wild-caught fish oil.

“The supplementation with Omega 3 fatty acids enhances the reproductive performance in dairy cattle” López-Paredes, 2024



• Circular Economy: Technologies like biochar (rich in carbon from pyrolysis) are utilized as feed additives to enhance gut health while providing a vehicle for long-term carbon sequestration and ammonia volatilization reduction.



Ultimately, these functional inputs work like fine-tuning a high-performance engine, ensuring biological machinery extracts maximum energy from feed while minimizing harmful "emissions" and resource waste.
