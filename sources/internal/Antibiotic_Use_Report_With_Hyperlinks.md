Antibiotic Use by Species Since 2015 – Full Report with Hyperlinked Sources

# I. Overview

This report summarizes changes in antibiotic use since 2015 across species in the EU, US, and globally, with explicit citations and hyperlinks to regulatory sources.

# II. European Union – ESVAC (EMA)

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) publishes ESVAC reports measuring antimicrobial sales in food-producing animals across the EU/EEA.

Key findings:
• −43% antimicrobial sales (2011–2020) in the 25-country cohort.
• −31% additional reduction from 2018 to 2022.
• Largest reductions in pigs and poultry, moderate in cattle.

# III. France – ANSES Species-Level Data

France provides the clearest species-level antibiotic exposure data in Europe.

Exposure reduction (2011–2020):
• Poultry: −64.4%
• Swine: −55.5%
• Cattle: −22.5%
• Rabbits: −39.9%
• Cats/Dogs: −11.8%

# IV. United States – FDA (Medically Important Antibiotics)

The FDA CVM publishes annual reports on medically important (MI) antibiotics used in food-producing animals.

Key findings:
• −35% MI antibiotic sales between 2015–2022.
• 2022 Species allocation (MI antibiotics): Swine 43%, Cattle 41%, Turkeys 12%, Chickens 2%.


# V. Global Trends – WOAH (World Organisation for Animal Health)

WOAH compiles mg/kg biomass antimicrobial use across regions, showing reductions since 2015.

Highlights:
• Significant reductions in many regions with stewardship policies.
• High variability in aquaculture usage depending on geography.


# VI. Species-by-Species Summary Since 2015

• Poultry: steepest global reductions.
• Swine: large reductions in EU/US due to stewardship and ZnO phaseout.
• Cattle: moderate reductions, still high absolute volumes in US.
• Aquaculture: inconsistent but improving.
• Companion animals: small share, modest reductions.

# VII. Implications for Nutraceutical Market

The steepest antibiotic reductions (poultry, swine) correspond to the strongest pull for gut-health, microbiome, immune-support and phytogenic nutraceutical innovations.
