II.8. Ectoparasite Control and Vector-Borne Risk Management

In most markets, true flea/tick or fly control is regulated as a pesticide or a drug, so “nutraceutical” products tend to sit in an adjunct space rather than a direct substitute.



II.8.1. Livestock: “feed-through” fly control is industrial and claims-based

In cattle operations, there is an established category of feed-through fly control where the active passes through the animal and acts in manure to disrupt larval development. Importantly, labels typically state it is not effective against existing adult flies and must be used as part of a broader integrated program (ClariFly label; Altosid IGR technical and label documents).

Diflubenzuron feed-through programs are positioned to prevent fly development in manure rather than kill adults (ClariFly labels).

S-methoprene feed-through is positioned as an insect growth regulator and described as passing into manure where flies lay eggs (Altosid IGR documents).

Horn fly burden is frequently described as a material productivity cost in beef systems; some industry materials cite very large aggregate impacts (Altosid IGR XRB FAQ).



II.8.2. Companion animals: “natural repellents” exist, but evidence and safety are uneven

Botanical actives (notably certain essential oils) show insecticidal/repellent activity in laboratory settings and small trials, but results are heterogeneous and often do not match the consistency of regulated products, particularly under real-world parasite pressure (Matsuda et al., 2020; reviews on essential oils/ectoparasites).

Safety and reputational risk is non-trivial in pets:

Garlic (Allium spp.) is widely marketed online as a “natural repellent”, but veterinary references warn of oxidative damage and Heinz body anemia risk in dogs and cats at sufficient exposure (Merck Veterinary Manual; PDSA). 

Investor takeaway: the “nutraceutical angle” in ectoparasites is most defensible as:

skin/coat support adjuncts,

environmental or integrated pest management tools, or

regulated actives presented in “friendlier” delivery or brand wrappers.
Trying to position these as a direct replacement for regulated parasiticides generally increases regulatory and litigation risk.

II.9. Nutrigenomics and Systemic Disease Prevention

Nutrigenomics is not a product category by itself. It is a product development and differentiation logic: using gene-expression, pathway biomarkers, and omics readouts to support claims such as resilience, gut integrity, immune responsiveness, and metabolic efficiency.

II.9.1. Why nutrigenomics shows up in animal nutrition investment theses

Nutrigenomics is increasingly used to:

identify plausible mechanisms (for example oxidative stress pathways like Nrf2),

stratify animals by response

build a more “pharma-like” evidence narrative for nutrition products (Deon et al., 2025; review literature on Nrf2 modulation by polyphenols such as curcumin).

Nutrigenomics aims to:

support premium pricing through stronger substantiation, and

create defensibility (data packages, proprietary biomarkers, formulation know-how), even when ingredients are not patent-protected.

II.9.2. Livestock and aquaculture: gut integrity and immune function as “antibiotic-alternative infrastructure”

A large portion of functional nutrition innovation in production animals targets the gut as the “control point” for performance and resilience:

MOS (mannan oligosaccharides) are widely discussed as prebiotics that can influence microbiota, pathogen interactions, and immune response across species (Sharma, 2024; Kiarie et al., 2012).

Butyrate and butyrate-releasing strategies are supported by mechanistic and animal evidence linked to barrier function and tight-junction biology; piglet work frequently anchors the practical narrative around weaning stress (Zeng et al., 2015).

In aquaculture, immune-support strategies often dominate because many species rely heavily on innate immunity, and vaccination is not broadly practical for some groups (notably shrimp) in the same way it is for terrestrial livestock (Hauton, 2021). 
Beta-glucans are among the most frequently studied immunostimulants in fish and shrimp contexts (Meena et al., 2013).



II.9.3. Interaction with vaccination and health programs

Some feed-derived compounds (including saponins and yeast-derived immunomodulators) are discussed as adjuvant-like tools that can modulate immune response and antibody readouts, but effect sizes depend on antigen, species, and baseline nutrition. Evidence exists in poultry and other species, but the most credible positioning is supportive rather than deterministic (Chen et al., 2021; Meena et al., 2013).

Gut health value bridge: microbiome modulation → barrier integrity → inflammation load → performance and medication outcomes (species-specific callouts: broilers, weaned piglets, fish).

Nutrigenomics workflow: ingredient → biomarker panel → responder segmentation → claim substantiation.



II.10. Advanced Formulations and Delivery Systems

Delivery format is not packaging. It is often the difference between a commodity ingredient and a scalable, defensible product with better compliance, stability, and repeat purchase.

II.10.1. Companion animals: compliance and repeat purchase economics

For dogs and cats, product-market fit is heavily driven by:

palatability (treat-like formats),

dosing convenience

brand trust.

This is why “chew” formats and flavored delivery systems are so widespread in pet supplements, even when the underlying bioactives are similar across brands. Market sizing sources differ on the exact split by format, but the direction is consistent: treat-like formats are a dominant innovation pathway in pet supplements.

II.10.2. Production animals: protection, targeting, and industrial compatibility

In livestock, advanced delivery systems often exist to solve one of three problems:

stability during processing,

survival through harsh digestive environments,

release at a specific site (for example hindgut delivery).

Evidence and reviews highlight microencapsulation as a key enabling technology to protect actives and improve delivery reliability (Almassri et al., 2024; Fontana et al., 2025).
Empirical studies in poultry also evaluate microencapsulated phytogenics (for example cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol) for performance and gut-related outcomes (Bosetti et al., 2020).

For ruminants, rumen-protection technologies (often lipid matrices) are central to delivering amino acids and other actives past the rumen; this is a mature and still-evolving area with both academic and applied literature (Inô et al., 2024; Fleming et al., 2019).

Controlled-release boluses represent another industrial delivery approach for minerals and monitoring, with studies assessing their performance as nutrient delivery systems (Carlisle et al., 2021).

II.11. Sustainability and the “Green Claim” Economy

Sustainability is moving from marketing to procurement logic in livestock and aquaculture, particularly where large buyers track Scope 3 emissions and nutrient footprints.

II.11.1. Methane mitigation in ruminants: from biology to carbon economics

Enteric fermentation is a major methane source, and the livestock share of methane is explicitly treated in climate assessments (IPCC, 2021).

Two high-profile solution families illustrate how “nutraceutical-like” additives can become compliance tools:

Asparagopsis (red seaweed): controlled feeding trials report large methane reductions under certain inclusion rates and diet contexts (Roque et al., 2021).

3-NOP (3-nitrooxypropanol): peer-reviewed work and meta-analyses commonly report methane reductions around the high-20% range, with ongoing attention on economics and who pays (Hristov et al., 2015; Pupo et al., 2025).

Recent regulatory momentum has also been visible in the US context for methane-reducing additives (Reuters, 2024).

II.11.2. Nutrient excretion: phosphorus and nitrogen as measurable externalities

For monogastrics, enzymes such as phytase are among the most established “sustainability and efficiency” tools because they can improve phosphorus utilization and reduce excretion, with effects supported by meta-analysis evidence in poultry (Afsharmanesh et al., 2023).

For nitrogen, strategies include better amino acid balance and protease use to improve protein utilization; meta-analyses in broilers evaluate protease effects on digestibility and performance outcomes, which is the operational route to lower nitrogen waste (Cowieson et al., 2020).

A related operational linkage is litter quality: high moisture and ammonia are repeatedly cited as drivers of footpad dermatitis risk, making “gut efficiency” interventions potentially relevant beyond pure growth metrics (Shepherd and Fairchild, 2010).

II.11.3. Omega-3 supply chain resilience: algae and fermentation as strategic inputs

Fish oil markets are exposed to marine supply volatility; microalgae (for example Schizochytrium) are frequently discussed as scalable DHA sources for aquaculture and, increasingly, other animal applications (Shah et al., 2023).

Sustainability-linked additives are increasingly evaluated through a three-part lens:

biological efficacy,

auditability (measurable reductions),

economics (premium, incentives, or carbon payments).
