# Executive Summary


# Definition, Scope and Structural Dynamics


I.1. Terminology
Veterinary nutraceuticals refer to orally administered, biologically active compounds derived from natural sources (plants, algae, fungi, yeast, microbial fermentation) intended to confer health benefits beyond basic nutrition. They differ from:

Nutritional supplements: essential nutrients (vitamins, minerals, amino/fatty acids) intended to address deficiencies.

Feed additives: substances added to feed or water for performance, sensory, or technological purposes (e.g. enzymes, binders, antioxidants).

Zootechnical additives: functional feed additives that improve animal performance (e.g. probiotics, digestibility enhancers).

Nutraceuticals exist in a regulatory grey zone: some fall under feed laws, others near therapeutic claims.



## I.2. Regulatory Landscape by Region 

Table summarizing the reglementation for each region

Figure: Venn Diagrams showing what is included in nutraceuticals depending on the country

### I.2.1. United States (US)

No formal regulatory category for "veterinary nutraceuticals"

Companion animal supplements fall under FDA-CVM and AAFCO guidelines

Products marketed as feed additives must use approved ingredients; therapeutic claims trigger drug classification

NASC labeling is a voluntary standard used in pet supplements

### I.2.2. European Union (EU)

Regulated under feed law: Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 for additives and complementary feeds

Zootechnical additives (ex probiotics, enzymes) require EFSA evaluation and EU approval

Supplements must not make medicinal claims; otherwise, they fall under EMA veterinary drug regulation

Strong focus on food safety and environmental risk for additives used in livestock/aquaculture

### I.2.3. United Kingdom (UK)

Post-Brexit regulatory alignment with EU, but under UK-specific authorities

Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) oversees veterinary medicinal products

Feed additives and supplements require FSA and VMD conformity

Potential for independent regulatory pathway and accelerated approvals post-EU

## V.2. Valuation trends

Valuations in the sector have bifurcated. Investors act differently toward "Pet Assets" (valued like Consumer Tech/Beauty) versus "Livestock Assets" (valued like Specialty Chemicals).

### V.2.1. The "Pet Premium" (15x – 20x+ EBITDA)

Assets serving the companion animal market command the highest multiples, driven by the "Humanization" thesis and recurring revenue models.

The "Soft Chew" Multiplier: Companies with successful soft chew formats command a premium because of high compliance (dogs eat them willingly), which drives repurchase rates.

Subscription Models: Brands with strong DTC subscription bases (e.g., YuMOVE) are valued closer to SaaS (Software as a Service) companies due to predictable cash flow.

Benchmark: Swedencare and H&H Group (Zesty Paws) transactions have historically set the ceiling, often trading at >4x Revenue or >18x EBITDA during peak market cycles.



### V.2.2. The "Livestock Stability" (10x – 14x EBITDA)

Assets serving poultry/swine are valued on stability, IP protection, and volume.

The "Green" Premium: Recently, valuations are ticking up for companies with patented sustainability solutions (e.g., methane reducers or antibiotic replacements). Investors are willing to pay more for "Climate Tech" within the feed space.

Consolidation Arbitrage: Private Equity firms (like EQT, Cinven) buy mid-sized players at ~10x EBITDA, merge them to create scale, and aim to sell at ~14x EBITDA.



### V.2.3. Current Valuation Drivers (2024-2025)

What is moving the needle right now?

Science > Hype: The market is cooling on "generic" white-label brands. Valuations are flowing toward companies with Clinical Studies (e.g., Nutramax, YuMOVE) that can survive regulatory scrutiny.

Omnichannel Capability: Pure DTC brands are seeing multiple compression due to rising ad costs (CAC). The highest value is now placed on "Omnichannel" brands that can succeed on Amazon and on the shelves of Walmart/Costco.

[INSERT FIGURE: Valuation Multiples by Sub-Sector (Trading Comps)] Data Visualization: Bar chart comparing EV/EBITDA multiples.

Pet E-Commerce/Brands: ~16x

Animal Health Pharma: ~14x

Feed Ingredients/Specialty Chem: ~11x

Commodity Feed: ~7x

[INSERT FIGURE: The "Valuation Bridge" - Factors expanding or compressing multiples]

Expanders: Recurring Revenue, Proprietary IP (Patents), Clinical Data, "Green" Claims.

Compressors: Single-channel risk (Amazon dependency), Commodity ingredients, Regulatory headwinds.
