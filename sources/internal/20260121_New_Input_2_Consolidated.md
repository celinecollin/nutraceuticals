# 1. Executive summary

**Draft fixes implemented in this version:**

- Expanded the report into an implementation-ready playbook with
  governance, evidence tiers, templates, and a detailed sources
  appendix.

- Added the postponed application dates for the EU Deforestation
  Regulation and implications for deforestation-risk claims and due
  diligence.

- Aligned the EU feed sector section to the published Copa-Cogeca/FEFAC
  Code of Good Labelling Practices v1.2 (2024-12) and its linkage to
  PEFCR Feed and GFLI.

- Corrected the status of the US Innovative FEED Act: introduced bills
  (H.R. 2203 and S. 1906) rather than enacted law.

- Updated EU regulatory landscape: EmpCo Directive timing and
  implications; EU Green Claims directive proposal described as paused
  rather than actively in trilogue.

Green labels are moving from optional marketing assets to
quasi-regulatory instruments. Across animal nutrition and pet care,
sustainability claims are increasingly constrained by (1) tighter
consumer protection rules, (2) procurement requirements that translate
Scope 3 emissions targets into supplier scorecards, and (3) industry
codes that standardize how environmental performance must be calculated
and communicated.

The practical effect is institutionalization: in the EU, the combination
of the Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition Directive (EmpCo)
and feed-sector initiatives (for example, the Copa-Cogeca and FEFAC Code
of Good Labelling Practices integrating PEFCR Feed and GFLI data) is
creating a de facto baseline for what counts as a legitimate
environmental claim. In the US, environmental marketing is still
primarily enforced through the FTC Act and state consumer protection
laws, but sector-specific policy efforts such as the Innovative FEED Act
illustrate a push to modernize the regulatory pathway for certain feed
ingredients intended to deliver animal performance, food safety, or
environmental benefits.

A two-speed market is emerging. In livestock feed, green labels are
becoming procurement signals tied to emissions reduction and compliance.
In pet care, green labels remain consumer-facing trust signals, but are
increasingly bounded by legal restrictions on generic claims, self-made
labels, and carbon-neutral style statements.

For manufacturers, the winning strategy is not to add more labels, but
to build a claims system: a governed portfolio of claims mapped to
evidence tiers, supported by auditable data, aligned with accepted
methodologies, and designed for multi-jurisdiction deployment.

**Key takeaways:**

- Regulation is increasingly focused on claim substantiation, not just
  label presence. Claim wording, scope, and proof matter more than the
  badge itself.

- Industry codes and databases (PEFCR Feed and GFLI) are becoming
  default references for feed environmental footprint communication in
  Europe.

- Offset-based product climate claims are being restricted or banned in
  the EU consumer context, pushing brands toward lifecycle-based product
  footprint evidence.

- Green labels will increasingly be evaluated in the context of
  farm-level and value-chain emissions reporting (Scope 3), accelerating
  demand for ingredient- and feed-level data.

- Companies should implement a defensible claims governance process now
  (inventory, evidence standards, verification, and packaging controls)
  before enforcement escalates.

# 2. Scope, definitions, and methodology

## 2.1 Scope

This report focuses on the institutionalization of environmental and
sustainability labels and claims (\"green labels\") in two adjacent
sectors:\
• Animal nutrition for food-producing animals (compound feed, premixes,
and feed additives)\
• Pet food and pet care products (food, treats, supplements, and
selected care categories where sustainability claims are common)

## 2.2 Geographic lens

The regulatory deep dive prioritizes the European Union and the United
States, because these markets are both large and highly influential in
setting labeling expectations. Where useful, the report also references
the United Kingdom, Canada, and other jurisdictions to highlight
convergence and divergence.

## 2.3 Definitions

**Green label:** Any symbol, badge, statement, or on-pack/off-pack
communication that signals an environmental or sustainability attribute,
performance, or commitment.

**Environmental claim:** A message or representation that states or
implies a product, ingredient, brand, or business has a positive,
reduced, or neutral environmental impact (for example, low-carbon,
recyclable, climate friendly).

**Sustainability label:** A label that distinguishes or promotes a
product, process, or business with reference to environmental or social
characteristics, often linked to a certification scheme.

**Certification scheme:** A structured program with defined criteria,
governance, and independent verification leading to the right to use a
mark or make a verified claim.

**Institutionalization:** The shift from voluntary, marketing-led use of
green labels to a system where labels are governed by regulation,
industry codes, procurement requirements, and audit expectations.

## 2.4 Methodology

The analysis combines:\
• Review of applicable or proposed regulatory instruments and guidance\
• Review of sector-specific codes and methodologies used for
environmental footprint communication\
• Market signal analysis (procurement expectations, certification
programs, and innovation themes)\
• Synthesis into an implementation playbook suitable for manufacturers,
ingredient suppliers, and brand owners

# 3. Why green labels are being institutionalized

## 3.1 Converging forces

Green labels used to be driven primarily by consumer preference and
brand differentiation. They are now being shaped by four converging
forces:

**Consumer protection enforcement:** Regulators and courts are
increasingly challenging vague or unsubstantiated sustainability claims.
The standard is shifting from \"can you say it\" to \"can you prove
it\".

**Supply chain and Scope 3 pressure:** Large food and consumer goods
companies increasingly require suppliers to provide emissions and
sustainability data to support their own reporting and reduction
targets.

**Standardization of LCA methods:** Life cycle assessment methodologies,
product footprint standards, and sector databases are reducing the room
for bespoke calculation approaches.

**Digitization of product information:** QR codes, product passports,
and retailer data requirements are increasing the amount and granularity
of sustainability information associated with products.

## 3.2 A two-speed market

The same label can serve very different functions depending on the
segment:\
• Livestock feed: labels are increasingly compliance and procurement
instruments tied to measurable outcomes (emissions, nutrient efficiency,
deforestation risk).\
• Pet care: labels remain consumer trust and premiumization signals, but
are increasingly constrained by rules against generic claims,
self-created labels, and offset-based climate claims.

# 4. Regulatory and standards landscape

## 4.1 European Union cross-cutting rules affecting green labels

### 4.1.1 Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition Directive

The EU has adopted a directive aimed at reducing greenwashing and
improving consumer information on durability and reparability. For green
labels, its most consequential elements are the new restrictions on
generic environmental claims, self-created labels, and certain
offset-based product climate claims. Member states must transpose the
directive into national law by March 27, 2026, and the requirements are
expected to apply from September 27, 2026. \[Source 1\]

**Practical implications for animal nutrition and pet care include:**

- Avoid broad, undefined terms (for example, \"eco-friendly\" or
  \"green\") unless the claim can be linked to recognized excellent
  environmental performance and is not misleading.

- Treat sustainability labels as regulated assets. Labels should be
  either established by a public authority or grounded in a credible
  certification scheme with independent verification.

- Reassess any product-level climate neutrality or climate-positive
  claims that rely on offsetting outside the product value chain, which
  face heightened restrictions in an EU consumer context.

### 4.1.2 Green Claims Directive proposal

The EU also proposed a separate directive to set detailed, harmonized
rules for substantiating and communicating explicit environmental claims
and labels. However, negotiations on the proposal were paused in June
2025 after political disagreement on scope, including concerns about
expanding obligations to very small companies. As of early 2026, the
proposal has not been finalized into EU law. \[Sources 2-4\]

Implication: companies should plan for a stricter evidence regime even
if a single EU-wide Green Claims directive is delayed, because EmpCo and
existing consumer protection enforcement already increase the risk of
weak or vague claims.

### 4.1.3 Corporate reporting and value chain data demand

Corporate sustainability reporting obligations in the EU are a
structural driver of green labels becoming data-backed. The European
Commission indicates that the first companies subject to the Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive have to apply the new rules for the
2024 financial year, with reports published in 2025. These reporting
expectations, including value-chain information, are a major reason
buyers increasingly ask suppliers for product and ingredient emissions
data. \[Source 5\]

### 4.1.4 Digital Product Passports and data disclosure

The EU\'s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation establishes a
framework that includes a Digital Product Passport, designed to store
product sustainability and compliance information. While implementation
varies by product group, the direction of travel is toward more
standardized, machine-readable sustainability data across supply chains.
\[Source 6\]

## 4.2 EU feed-specific institutionalization

### 4.2.1 Baseline feed marketing rules

Environmental labeling in feed operates on top of existing feed
marketing and labeling requirements. In practice, feed environmental
claims must be consistent with general principles against misleading
marketing and must be substantiated.

### 4.2.2 Copa-Cogeca and FEFAC Code of Good Labelling Practices

A major institutional signal in Europe is the endorsement of the
upgraded Copa-Cogeca and FEFAC Code of Good Labelling Practices for
compound feed by the European Commission\'s Standing Committee on
Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCoPAFF) at its meeting of 2-3 December
(the code is published in the 2024-12 version). The updated code
provides a harmonized approach to communicating environmental
performance, integrates the PEFCR Feed for Food-Producing Animals
methodology and the Global Feed LCA Institute (GFLI) database, and
references communication across multiple environmental impact
categories. \[Source 7\]

Why this matters: even though the code is not an EU regulation, it
functions as a sector-wide playbook. For manufacturers, it effectively
defines what \"good practice\" looks like for environmental footprint
communication in B2B feed markets.

## 4.3 United States cross-cutting rules affecting green labels

### 4.3.1 FTC guidance and consumer protection enforcement

In the US, the Federal Trade Commission\'s Green Guides remain a key
reference point for environmental marketing claims. The Guides are
designed to help marketers avoid making environmental claims that
mislead consumers and are widely used as a yardstick for substantiation
and clarity. As of early 2025, reporting indicates that an updated
version had not yet been released. \[Sources 8-9\]

### 4.3.2 Industry self-regulation and litigation risk

In addition to regulator action, US green claims face scrutiny through
state consumer protection laws, class-action litigation, and advertising
self-regulation. This creates a risk landscape where even technically
accurate claims can be challenged if they are perceived as overbroad or
inadequately qualified.

## 4.4 US feed and pet-specific pathways

### 4.4.1 FDA claim boundaries for animal food substances

The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates animal food and animal
drugs. Claim wording can determine which pathway applies. In a May 21,
2024 letter, FDA noted industry interest in animal food substances that
act solely within the gut with claims related to animal production,
animal well-being, food safety, and environmental benefits, and
encouraged firms to contact FDA early in product development. \[Source
10\]

### 4.4.2 The Innovative FEED Act and zootechnical animal food substances

Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to create a defined
regulatory pathway for a new category termed \"zootechnical animal food
substances\". The House bill (H.R. 2203) was introduced March 18, 2025,
and the Senate bill (S. 1906) was introduced May 22, 2025. These bills
define the category and would regulate such substances as food additives
rather than as animal drugs under specified conditions. As of early
2026, the bills are introduced but not enacted. \[Sources 11-13\]

**Strategic relevance:**

If enacted, the Innovative FEED Act could accelerate the commercial
pathway for certain feed ingredients that deliver measurable
environmental outcomes (for example, methane reduction or nutrient
efficiency) while remaining within a food additive framework. Even
before enactment, the policy debate signals that regulators and industry
are grappling with how to handle substantiated environmental benefit
claims.

### 4.4.3 Pet care categories with unique regulatory triggers

In pet care, some product categories have claim triggers outside food
law. For example, flea and tick products are often regulated as
pesticides, and claim substantiation may fall under pesticide rules.
Brands should treat such categories as high-risk for both safety and
greenwashing claims because the combination of health-related and
environmental language can create regulatory exposure.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Green label taxonomy for feed and pet care

## 5.1 A practical hierarchy of green labels

For implementation, it is useful to treat green labels as a hierarchy
with increasing evidentiary burden:

**Tier 0: Silent sustainability features:** Internal sustainability
improvements with no external claim. Lowest legal risk, but no market
signaling.

**Tier 1: Specific attribute claims:** Narrow, verifiable statements
about a defined attribute (for example, \"made with 30% recycled
plastic\"), supported by documentation.

**Tier 2: Comparative claims:** Claims that compare to a baseline or
competitor (for example, \"20% lower carbon footprint vs 2023 recipe\").
Requires strict methodological controls.

**Tier 3: Aggregated footprint claims:** Product footprint, lifecycle,
or environmental score claims (for example, PEF-based metrics). Requires
LCA competence, data quality controls, and often third-party review.

**Tier 4: Certified labels and seals:** Use of a certification mark (for
example, a third-party sustainability label). Requires compliance with
scheme rules and audit readiness.

**Tier 5: Multi-attribute sustainability labels:** Labels implying broad
sustainability leadership (for example, \"sustainable product\"), which
are high-risk unless backed by recognized excellent performance across
relevant categories.

## 5.2 Core claim and label categories

Across both livestock feed and pet care, most green labels cluster into
recurring categories. Understanding these categories helps brands
standardize evidence, avoid overreach, and design a portfolio that can
be scaled.

**Carbon and climate:** Product carbon footprint, low-carbon, climate
impact reduction, methane reduction related messaging.

**Circularity and waste reduction:** Upcycled ingredients, by-product
utilization, circular feed, food waste diversion.

**Deforestation and land use:** Deforestation-free sourcing, certified
soy, land-use change risk management.

**Biodiversity and regenerative practices:** Regenerative agriculture
inputs, biodiversity-friendly sourcing, soil health claims.

**Water and eutrophication:** Water use, nutrient runoff, eutrophication
footprint, nitrogen efficiency.

**Packaging sustainability:** Recyclability, recycled content, refill,
compostability, lightweighting.

**Chemical and toxicity positioning:** Claims about reduced hazardous
substances, \"no neurotoxin\" style language in care categories, and
clean label positioning.

**Animal welfare and social attributes:** Welfare-related claims and
farm assurance programs that intersect with sustainability perceptions.

## 5.3 Livestock feed: green label archetypes

In livestock systems, green labels are increasingly tied to measurable
outcomes and procurement scorecards. The most common archetypes include:

**Low-carbon feed:** A footprint claim tied to ingredient sourcing,
formulation, and processing energy; often expressed per kg feed or per
functional unit.

**Methane-reducing feed or additive:** A performance claim requiring
robust evidence of enteric methane reduction and clear definition of
conditions and expected results.

**Nutrient efficiency and eutrophication reduction:** Claims about
improved digestibility, reduced nitrogen or phosphorus excretion, or
lower eutrophication impact.

**Deforestation-risk managed feed:** Sourcing claims for soy or other
high-risk commodities backed by certification and traceability.

**Circular feed:** Use of co-products and former foodstuffs positioned
as waste reduction; requires careful messaging to avoid safety concerns.

## 5.4 Pet food and pet care: green label archetypes

In pet markets, sustainability claims are often bundled with health,
safety, and ethics. Common archetypes include:

**Upcycled ingredients:** Positioning that ingredients would otherwise
be wasted. Increasingly supported by formal certification (for example,
Upcycled Certified). \[Source 14\]

**Alternative proteins:** Insect protein, fermentation-derived
ingredients, plant-based proteins, positioned as lower-impact
alternatives.

**Sustainable seafood:** Marine sustainability certification for
fish-based diets (for example, MSC/ASC) and fishery improvement
narratives.

**Sustainable packaging:** Recyclable or recycled-content packaging
claims, often subject to evolving recyclability standards and FTC
guidance.

**Clean chemistry positioning:** Claims in care products (shampoos, flea
and tick, grooming) that avoid certain active ingredients, sometimes
framed as environmental or health safer.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Auditability, data, and assurance requirements

## 6.1 The new expectation: substantiation as a product

As green labels become institutionalized, the substantiation package
becomes as important as the product. Across jurisdictions, regulators
and customers increasingly expect claims to be:

- Specific (clear about what is being claimed and what is not).

- Quantified where possible (especially for footprint, reduction, or
  comparative statements).

- Methodologically grounded (using accepted standards and sector rules).

- Documented (traceable evidence that can be produced during an audit or
  challenge).

- Kept current (updated when formulations, suppliers, processes, or
  markets change).

## 6.2 Life cycle assessment frameworks relevant to green labels

Most robust green label programs are built on life cycle assessment
(LCA). Depending on geography and buyer expectations, the dominant
frameworks include:

**EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF):** The EU recommends
LCA-based methods to quantify environmental impacts of products and
organizations. PEF typically evaluates multiple impact categories and
relies on Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) for
product-specific rules. \[Sources 15-16\]

**PEFCR Feed for Food-Producing Animals:** The feed sector has a
dedicated PEFCR that sets rules for calculating the environmental
footprint of compound feed for food-producing animals. \[Source 17\]

**GFLI feed ingredient datasets:** The Global Feed LCA Institute
maintains a feed LCA database of ingredient datasets built using LCA
methodology, supporting more consistent feed footprint calculations.
\[Source 18\]

**ISO 14067:** An international standard specifying principles,
requirements, and guidelines for quantification and reporting of the
carbon footprint of a product. \[Source 19\]

**GHG Protocol Product Standard:** A global standard for product life
cycle greenhouse gas accounting and reporting used to understand full
life cycle emissions and identify reduction opportunities. \[Source 20\]

## 6.3 Data architecture for defensible claims

A scalable green label system requires a data architecture that links
claims to underlying datasets. At minimum, companies should expect to
manage:

- Ingredient identity, sourcing geography, and chain-of-custody
  documentation.

- Supplier certifications and audit documents (for example,
  deforestation-risk programs, recycled content attestations).

- Recipe and formulation version control (so claims can be tied to a
  specific BOM and time period).

- Energy, transport, and manufacturing data used in LCA models.

- Allocation rules and functional units (especially for co-products and
  by-products).

- Assurance artifacts (internal review sign-off, third-party
  verification statements, and versioned calculation files).

## 6.4 Assurance and verification models

Verification can range from internal review to full third-party
certification. The right model depends on claim risk, customer
expectations, and jurisdiction.

**Internal controls:** Appropriate for narrow, low-risk attribute claims
when evidence is clear and retrievable.

**Independent expert review:** Useful for footprint and comparative
claims, especially when methodologies are complex.

**Third-party verification to a standard:** Common for product carbon
footprint and for certification labels; can increase credibility and
reduce litigation risk.

**Full certification schemes:** Necessary when using a program\'s label
or seal. Requires audit readiness and adherence to governance rules.

# 7. Segment implications: livestock feed

## 7.1 The role of feed in agricultural footprint accounting

In most livestock systems, feed production is a major contributor to the
environmental footprint of animal products. This makes feed a primary
lever for processors, retailers, and brands seeking to reduce Scope 3
emissions. As a result, green labels in feed are increasingly less about
consumer marketing and more about measurable inputs into downstream
product footprints.

## 7.2 How procurement turns sustainability targets into feed requirements

Procurement teams increasingly translate sustainability targets into
supplier requirements. In practice, this looks like:

- Supplier scorecards requiring product carbon footprint data per
  ingredient and per finished feed.

- Requirements for deforestation-risk mitigation for commodities such as
  soy and palm-derived ingredients.

- Documentation of co-product use, circular feed ingredients, and waste
  diversion metrics.

- Evidence of animal performance improvements that reduce emissions
  intensity (for example, improved feed conversion ratios).

## 7.3 Deforestation risk and soy: a label that becomes a license to operate

Deforestation-related sourcing is likely to remain a high-stakes
dimension of green labeling, especially for soy. The EU Deforestation
Regulation has been amended and its entry into application is now set
for large and medium operators on December 30, 2026, and for micro and
small operators on June 30, 2027. This timeline increases the urgency
for traceability systems and credible sourcing programs that can support
both due diligence and claims. \[Sources 21-22\]

For feed companies, deforestation-free sourcing claims should be treated
as compliance-adjacent. Even when a claim is made in B2B contexts, it
may be audited through customer due diligence or challenged under
misleading marketing standards.

## 7.4 Product innovation pathways that can support defensible labels

The following innovation pathways are most likely to produce labels that
matter in procurement and can be substantiated:

**Reformulation and sourcing shifts:** Lower-impact ingredients,
improved sourcing geographies, renewable energy in manufacturing, and
optimized logistics.

**Additives with measurable outcomes:** Substances that improve feed
efficiency, reduce enteric methane, or reduce nutrient excretion,
provided evidence and regulatory positioning are aligned.

**Circular feed inputs:** Former foodstuffs and co-products that
demonstrably divert waste and maintain safety, supported by traceability
and clear scope limitations.

**Data-enabled services:** Footprint calculators, formulation tools, and
reporting services that package sustainability data for customers,
increasing switching costs and loyalty.

## 7.5 Commercial implications and pricing models

As labels become tied to measurable outcomes, commercial models can
evolve beyond simple price premiums:

- Pay-for-performance models linked to verified outcomes (for example,
  emissions reduction per ton of output).

- Shared value contracts where a portion of downstream emissions-value
  is shared with feed suppliers.

- Bundling of product plus data, where the sustainability data package
  becomes part of the SKU value.

# 8. Segment implications: pet food and pet care

## 8.1 Consumer sustainability is real, but trust is fragile

In pet categories, sustainability is often expressed through packaging
cues, ingredient stories, and brand purpose narratives. Innovation trend
coverage from industry analysts highlights themes such as sustainable
packaging and upcycled ingredients in pet retail showcases. \[Sources
23-24\]

However, consumer trust is fragile. Generic green terms and self-created
labels can backfire as enforcement against greenwashing increases.
Brands need to shift from aspirational language to specific, verifiable
statements and credible third-party programs.

## 8.2 Upcycled ingredients and circularity: from niche to mainstream signal

Upcycled claims are particularly prominent in pet treats and specialty
diets because they combine sustainability with \"ingredient story\"
appeal. The Upcycled Certified program, created by the Upcycled Food
Association and now operated within the Where Food Comes From family of
standards, is a notable institutional mechanism that can help
substantiate upcycled claims and reduce greenwashing risk. \[Sources 14,
25-27\]

Implementation caution: a credible upcycled claim should establish that
the input stream would have gone to waste in a relevant market context,
and should avoid implying that all co-products are automatically waste.

## 8.3 Alternative proteins: insect and novel inputs

Insect protein and other alternative proteins are used as sustainability
narratives in pet food. A 2022 Reuters report describes efforts to scale
insect protein for pet diets, noting both footprint advantages and
evolving regulatory acceptance. \[Source 28\]

For green labels, alternative proteins create a double requirement: the
sustainability case must be evidence-based, and the ingredient must be
compliant with animal food rules (ingredient definitions, safety, and
permissible claims).

## 8.4 Product footprint approaches for pet food in Europe

Europe is also moving toward standardized footprinting approaches in pet
food. The European pet food industry has published information on a
PEFCR for pet food that establishes a standardized framework for
assessing environmental impacts of prepared pet food sold in the EU
market. \[Source 29\]

## 8.5 Packaging: the most visible sustainability cue

Packaging remains the most visible sustainability cue in pet aisles.
However, recyclability and recycled content claims are high-risk when
local recycling infrastructure does not match claim language. Brands
should align packaging claims with accepted guidance (for example, FTC
Green Guides in the US and national packaging rules in Europe) and avoid
overpromising.

## 8.6 Care products: beware of overlapping health and green claims

Pet care categories such as flea and tick, grooming, and household
products often intersect with pesticide, biocide, or chemical safety
regimes. When a brand combines \"natural\" or \"non-toxic\" messaging
with environmental benefit claims, the claim burden increases and
regulatory triggers can change. These categories should be treated as
high-risk for both compliance and reputation.

# 9. Competitive landscape and illustrative case studies

## 9.1 What "competitive landscape" means for green labels

The competitive landscape for green labels is less about who has the
most badges, and more about who can operationalize defensible claims at
scale. Three differentiators are increasingly decisive:\
• Evidence strength: ability to produce an auditable substantiation
dossier\
• Method alignment: use of accepted standards and sector rules, enabling
comparability\
• Deployment capability: integration into product development,
procurement, labeling, and customer reporting

## 9.2 Case study: methane-reducing feed additives as a new claim frontier

Methane-reducing additives illustrate how environmental benefit claims
can move from R&D to regulated authorization and then into market
labeling. For example, the EU has authorized a preparation of
3-nitrooxypropanol as a feed additive for dairy cows and cows for
reproduction under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/565.
This authorization is frequently cited in public discussion of
environmental-benefit feed additives. \[Sources 30-32\]

Implementation lessons:\
• Evidence must cover efficacy under defined use conditions and safety
for animals, users, and consumers.\
• Claims should be tightly scoped (species, diet, dose, expected
performance range).\
• Downstream labeling (for example, \"lower methane milk\") usually
requires additional value-chain accounting and governance.

## 9.3 Case study: Upcycled Certified as an institutional mechanism in pet markets

Upcycled certification demonstrates how a voluntary concept becomes
institutionalized through standards and governance. The Upcycled
Certified program provides a definition and certification mechanism for
upcycled claims, and is promoted as a way to bring consistency to a
category that otherwise risks vague marketing. \[Sources 14, 25-27\]

Implementation lessons:\
• Define what qualifies as \"upcycled\" in the relevant context.\
• Maintain chain-of-custody evidence and recipe-level mass balance.\
• Avoid broad claims that imply an entire product is upcycled unless
this is true.

## 9.4 Case study: carbon-neutral product messaging under rising scrutiny

Carbon neutrality claims for consumer products face rising scrutiny in
Europe, especially when they rely on offsetting. Coverage of European
developments highlights that the Empowering Consumers directive
framework is expected to restrict certain offset-based product climate
claims, pushing brands toward lifecycle-based substantiation and away
from simple offset narratives. \[Sources 1, 33\]

# 10. Implementation playbook for a defensible green label program

## 10.1 Design principle: treat claims like regulated products

A green label program should be managed like a regulated product
portfolio. Each claim should have an owner, a defined scope, an evidence
package, a review cadence, and clear rules for use across channels.

## 10.2 Governance model

Recommended governance structure:

**Green Claims Steering Committee:** Sets policy, approves high-risk
claims, and arbitrates trade-offs between marketing and compliance.

**Claims Owner:** Accountable for each claim\'s definition, scope, and
evidence package; typically product management or sustainability.

**Regulatory and Legal:** Defines claim risk, ensures compliance by
jurisdiction, and approves final language.

**Science and LCA:** Owns calculation methodologies, data quality
controls, and update triggers.

**Quality and Procurement:** Maintains supplier documentation, audits,
and traceability evidence.

**Commercial and Marketing:** Deploys claims in packaging, sales
materials, and digital channels within approved guardrails.

## 10.3 Step-by-step implementation process

**Step 1. Build a claims inventory:** Collect every
sustainability-related statement used across packaging, websites, sales
decks, tender responses, and retailer content. Include implied claims
embedded in imagery and icons.

**Step 2. Classify claims by risk and jurisdiction:** Assign each claim
a risk rating based on breadth, quantification, comparative nature,
reliance on offsets, and whether it triggers a regulated category (for
example, pesticides, drugs).

**Step 3. Define evidence requirements per claim type:** Use an evidence
hierarchy (Appendix A) to define what documentation is mandatory,
optional, and unacceptable.

**Step 4. Build the data backbone:** Implement recipe version control,
supplier documentation management, and an LCA workflow aligned to
PEF/ISO/GHG Protocol expectations as required.

**Step 5. Select verification and certification strategy:** Decide where
independent verification is required (for example, footprint claims,
reduction claims, and high-visibility consumer claims).

**Step 6. Establish packaging and content controls:** Implement an
approval workflow that prevents unapproved claims from appearing on pack
or online. Maintain a single source of truth for approved claim
language.

**Step 7. Engage suppliers with contractual data requirements:** Embed
data and documentation obligations into supplier contracts, including
update triggers when suppliers change processes or sourcing.

**Step 8. Implement monitoring and refresh cadence:** Set a review cycle
(for example, quarterly for high-risk claims, annually for footprint
models) and define triggers that require immediate review.

# 11. Scenarios and early warning indicators

## 11.1 Scenario planning logic

Because green label institutionalization depends on political,
regulatory, and market dynamics, scenario planning helps avoid
overfitting to a single path. The scenarios below are not predictions.
They are structured possibilities that can be monitored through early
warning indicators.

## 11.2 Scenario A: Harmonized EU substantiation returns

The EU revives or replaces the paused Green Claims directive proposal
with a harmonized substantiation regime. Pre-approval or formal
verification requirements become more explicit, and national enforcement
becomes more consistent.

**What it would mean:**

- Higher upfront compliance costs for consumer-facing claims.

- Greater comparability across products, increasing competitive
  pressure.

- Advantages for companies with mature LCA and verification systems.

## 11.3 Scenario B: Fragmentation plus enforcement

The EU Green Claims proposal remains stalled, but EmpCo is transposed
and enforced aggressively. Member states and courts apply consumer
protection law more actively, and national guidance diverges.

**What it would mean:**

- Need for country-specific claim playbooks and legal review.

- Higher risk for generic and aspirational claims, even without an
  EU-wide Green Claims directive.

- Value of robust evidence remains high, but claims must be tailored by
  jurisdiction.

## 11.4 Scenario C: US pathway modernization and tougher marketing scrutiny

US policy evolves in two directions: (1) a clearer pathway for certain
feed substances that deliver environmental benefits, and (2) increased
scrutiny of consumer-facing environmental marketing through FTC, state
actions, and litigation.

**What it would mean:**

- Faster commercialization for substantiated feed performance solutions
  if legislation advances.

- Greater need to harmonize claim substantiation across digital commerce
  and packaging.

- Potential for large financial exposure from class actions if claims
  are ambiguous.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. Recommendations

## 12.1 Immediate priorities

- Freeze high-risk claims until substantiation is reviewed, especially
  broad or generic terms and any climate-neutral language that relies on
  offsetting in EU consumer contexts.

- Create a single, governed library of approved claim language and
  prohibited terms by jurisdiction.

- Launch a claims inventory and risk assessment across all channels
  (packaging, web, retailer content, sales materials).

- Select a reference methodology for footprint claims (PEF/PEFCR where
  relevant in Europe, ISO 14067 and GHG Protocol Product Standard as
  global anchors) and standardize functional units.

- Identify 1-2 pilot products or customer accounts to build an
  end-to-end substantiation dossier and verification workflow.

## 12.2 Medium-term priorities

- Scale data collection through supplier contracts, requesting
  ingredient-level footprints, certification documents, and update
  triggers.

- Implement LCA governance with version control so that claims remain
  tied to specific formulations and time periods.

- Build a verification strategy: decide which claims require independent
  review and which can remain internal.

- Develop a product innovation pipeline aligned to defensible label
  archetypes, prioritizing measurable outcomes and procurement relevance
  in livestock feed and trust-building certifications in pet markets.

- Prepare for EU enforcement by building documentation that can
  withstand audits and challenges from regulators, customers, and
  competitors.

## 12.3 Long-term priorities

- Integrate sustainability data and claim review into product
  development stage gates, so claims are designed in, not retrofitted.

- Automate data pipelines for footprint reporting, enabling faster
  customer responses and reduced manual error.

- Use digital channels (QR codes and online product pages) to provide
  qualified, transparent information that supports on-pack brevity
  without sacrificing substantiation.

- Continuously monitor regulatory changes and enforcement patterns, and
  refresh claim language accordingly.

# Appendix A. Evidence hierarchy and claim substantiation checklist

## A1. Evidence hierarchy

Use this hierarchy to set minimum substantiation requirements. Higher
tiers include the requirements of lower tiers.

**Tier 1 evidence:** Supplier specs, certificates of analysis, recycled
content attestations, chain-of-custody documents.

**Tier 2 evidence:** Structured calculations with documented
assumptions, controlled baselines, and internal QA sign-off.

**Tier 3 evidence:** LCA study or footprint model aligned to a
recognized standard (PEF/PEFCR, ISO 14067, GHG Product Standard) with
version control.

**Tier 4 evidence:** Independent verification statement or certification
audit record.

**Tier 5 evidence:** Ongoing surveillance audits, governance documents
for label use, and public-facing methodology disclosure where required.

## A2. Claim substantiation checklist

- Claim text and context: exact wording, images, and implied meanings.

- Jurisdictions and channels: where the claim will appear (pack, web,
  retailer listing, B2B tender).

- Claim type classification: attribute, comparative, footprint, future
  commitment, certification label.

- Scope and boundary: what is included and excluded; functional unit;
  geography; time period.

- Methodology: standard or program used; key assumptions; allocation
  rules.

- Data sources: primary vs secondary; supplier data quality; update
  triggers.

- Evidence file set: documents, model files, certificates, and approvals
  stored in a controlled repository.

- Review and approval: legal, regulatory, science/LCA, quality, and
  marketing sign-off recorded.

- Monitoring plan: cadence and triggers for review when suppliers,
  formulations, processes, or regulations change.

## A3. Template: Green claim substantiation dossier contents

A practical dossier package for each high-visibility claim should
include:

- One-page claim summary (claim text, products/SKUs covered,
  jurisdictions, and limitations).

- Methodology note (standard used, boundary, functional unit,
  allocation, and data year).

- Calculation workbook or model file with version number and change log.

- Supplier evidence (certificates, declarations, chain-of-custody, audit
  summaries).

- Verification or review statement (if applicable).

- Packaging and digital copy approvals.

- Customer-facing FAQ and qualified disclosure text.
