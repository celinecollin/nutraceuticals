Title: Nutrigenomics in Animal Health: A Review of Longevity and Performance Linkages
Accessed: 2026-02-08

Key Findings:
- Nutrigenomics links dietary components to gene expression modifications (mTOR, AMPK pathways).
- Caloric restriction and specific modulation of macronutrients (e.g., restricted protein) are proven to extend lifespan in model organisms.
- "Longevity-linked protocols" involve targeting oxidative phosphorylation genes and mitochondrial biogenesis.
- Precision nutrition allows for phenotype-specific formulation, moving beyond generic breed averages.

This supports the "frontier framework" claims regarding gene-editing adjacencies and lifespan extension pathways.
