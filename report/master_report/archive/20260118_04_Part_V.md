# V. Notable Transactions and Investment Landscape (2015 to 2025) 20260113.docx



VI. Notable Transactions and Investment Landscape (2015 to 2025)

Since 2015, the animal nutraceutical, supplements, and specialty feed additive ecosystem has shifted from a fragmented brand-and-ingredient universe into an increasingly structured deal market with strategic consolidation and specialized private equity participation. Transactions now clearly signal where value is being created and captured across the chain.​

Key consolidation themes:

Companion animal health and supplements: consolidation around science-backed brands, omnichannel distribution, veterinary credibility, and recurring consumption; premium assets can reach 15–25x EBITDA.​

Livestock and aquaculture: consolidation around functional performance inputs (enzymes, probiotics, phytogenics, postbiotics, medicated feed additives, methane-reduction solutions) that sit at the intersection of regulation, productivity, and sustainability, typically at 10–15x EBITDA.​

Upstream omega-3 and functional lipids: investment and restructuring around alternative omega-3 sources (algal, krill) tied to aquaculture demand and premium pet applications.​

Distribution and data: growing PE interest in vet clinics, e-commerce platforms, and vet support organisations as “picks and shovels” to control customer relationships and private-label opportunities.​





VI.1 Major M&A and strategic transactions (2015–2025)

VI.1.1 Companion animals: brands, formats, and omnichannel scale

Swedencare acquires NaturVet (USA)​
Swedencare’s deal for NaturVet is a clean benchmark for premium pet supplement valuation when strong brands, retail reach, and in-house soft-chew manufacturing come together.​

Purchase price: about USD 447.5 million (cash, shares, and potential earn-out).​

2021 preliminary adjusted EBITDA: USD 20.9 million (32.7% margin).​

Implied multiple: 21.4x 2021 adjusted EBITDA (22.7x including full earn-out).​

This shows the “pet premium” in practice: high-margin formats, strong Amazon/Chewy velocity, and scale manufacturing can justify low-20s EBITDA multiples.​

H&H Group acquires Zesty Paws (USA)​
Zesty Paws is a digitally native supplement brand built on functional soft chews and dominance of online marketplaces.

Transaction value: USD 610 million.​

Revenue trajectory: roughly USD 3 million to 100+ million during the holding period.​

The multiple is not disclosed, but the relationship between deal value and scale implies a very rich revenue multiple, underlining the market’s willingness to pay for fast-growing, e-commerce-led platforms.​

Gryphon Investors-backed Vetnique Labs acquires Lintbells (YuMOVE, UK)​
This cross-border deal combines two science-backed chronic-care supplement brands.

Target: Lintbells (YuMOVE for mobility, plus gut, anxiety, dermatology products).​

Seller: Inflexion, which reportedly achieved around a 5.5x return.​

Buyer: Vetnique Labs, backed by Gryphon Investors.​

Terms: Not disclosed.​

The transaction illustrates PE platform building: Vetnique adds a leading UK/EU mobility brand to its US stool-and-gut health franchise, creating a transatlantic chronic-care portfolio with strong veterinary credibility.​

Morgan Stanley Capital Partners acquires FoodScience (VetriScience, USA)​
FoodScience is a vertically integrated supplements platform across human and pet categories.

Previous owner: Wind Point Partners (acquired 2021).​

New owner: Morgan Stanley Capital Partners (2024).​

Brands: VetriScience, DaVinci, Pet Naturals.​

The sponsor-to-sponsor sale confirms strong institutional appetite for assets with manufacturing, brand portfolios, and cross-species formulations.​

Vestar Capital Partners majority investment in PetHonesty (USA)​
Vestar’s 2021 majority deal for PetHonesty reflects interest in premium, functional pet supplements across joint, digestive, and immune categories.

Terms: Undisclosed, but positioned as a platform for omnichannel and DTC expansion.​







VI.1.2 Strategic acquisitions by large consumer and animal-health players



Mars Petcare acquires Champion Petfoods (ORIJEN, ACANA)​
Completion in 2023 gave Mars control of high-protein, grain-free premium brands ORIJEN and ACANA, deepening its presence in the ultra-premium nutrition segment; terms were not disclosed.​

Mars Petcare acquires Nom Nom (fresh, DTC)​
Mars’ acquisition of fresh-food subscription brand Nom Nom (press estimates around USD 1 billion, not confirmed) demonstrates strategic appetite for recurring-revenue, wellness-positioned DTC models.​

General Mills acquires Blue Buffalo​
The 2018 purchase of Blue Buffalo remains a landmark transaction.

Enterprise value: about USD 8.0 billion.​

It validated premium pet as a scalable growth platform for large CPG groups and anchored valuation expectations for branded pet nutrition assets.​

Nestlé Purina takes majority in Tails.com (UK)​
The 2018 deal brought a personalised, subscription-based pet food platform into Purina’s portfolio, strengthening its DTC and data capabilities; financial terms were undisclosed.​







VI.1.3 Livestock and aquaculture: specialty feed additives and functional inputs

Phibro acquires Zoetis medicated feed additive portfolio​

Purchase price: USD 350 million.​

Revenue base: Zoetis disclosed about USD 400 million of 2023 revenue.​

Assets: Medicated feed additives and water-soluble products, plus six manufacturing sites.​

Close: October 31, 2024.​

This is a rare, fully disclosed functional-feed deal and shows how regulated portfolios with entrenched customers are priced and integrated by a specialist operator.​

DSM acquires Erber Group (BIOMIN, Romer Labs)​

Purchase price: EUR 980 million (2020).​

Focus: Eubiotics, mycotoxin-risk management, gut-health solutions.​

The transaction shifted DSM-Firmenich further toward high-value health and performance solutions in feed.​

Cargill buys Diamond V (postbiotics)​
Cargill’s acquisition of Diamond V added yeast-based postbiotic and gut-health solutions to its animal-nutrition portfolio; terms remain undisclosed but the asset is considered a cornerstone in its health solutions strategy.​

Cargill acquires Delacon (phytogenics)​

Completion: 2022 (remaining shares).​

Focus: Plant-based phytogenic feed additives for productivity and antibiotic-reduction strategies.​

ADM acquires Neovia (InVivo)​

Enterprise value: EUR 1.535 billion (2018).​

Effect: Created a global value-added premix and specialty ingredient platform within ADM.​

Nutreco premix and additive bolt-ons​

Advit (2016) and Nutrimin (2021) expanded Nutreco’s premix, minerals, and specialty-ingredient capabilities in Europe.​







VI.1.4 Upstream functional lipids and omega-3

DSM–Evonik Veramaris JV (algal omega-3)​

Announced: 2017.​

Purpose: Large-scale algae-based omega-3 production for aquafeed and, secondarily, pet supplements.​

This JV reduces dependence on fish-oil supply and underpins ESG narratives in aquaculture and premium pet products.​

Aker BioMarine sells Feed Ingredients business (Aker QRILL Company)​

Valuation: USD 590 million enterprise value.​

Buyer: American Industrial Partners (AIP), with Aker retaining a minority stake.​

The deal monetises krill-based omega-3 feed ingredients and signals investor willingness to own upstream lipid supply platforms.​

Novonesis acquires DSM-Firmenich’s stake in Feed Enzymes Alliance​

Purchase price: EUR 1.5 billion.​

Completion: June 2025.​

This consolidates enzyme supply in a single fermentation specialist and is one of the largest disclosed transactions in the feed-enzyme niche.​

VI.3 Selected deal table (2015–2025)









VI.4 Valuation benchmarks and market signals



Swedencare–NaturVet (2022): 21.4x 2021 adjusted EBITDA on a 32.7% margin, demonstrating premium pricing for high-margin, omnichannel soft-chew platforms.​

Zesty Paws (2021): USD 610m consideration on >USD 100m revenue implies a high single- to low-double-digit revenue multiple for fast-growing DTC brands.​

Dechra (2023): Take-private at about 25.9x EBITDA and GBP 4.88bn EV, setting a top-tier benchmark for scaled, innovation-driven animal-health platforms.​

Market multiples: A Q2-2025 deal review shows median EV/EBITDA of 12.2x for pet-sector deals, versus 16.8x in 2024, reflecting some multiple compression but still mid-teens pricing for quality assets.​

Pet supplements market: Estimated at about USD 3.6bn in 2024 with 5.6% projected CAGR through 2034, underpinning continued investor interest.​



VI.5 Strategic vs financial sponsor patterns



Strategic buyers (Mars, Nestlé, General Mills, Cargill, ADM, DSM-Firmenich, Phibro) dominate larger, synergistic acquisitions where integration into existing supply chains or brand portfolios is key.​

Financial sponsors (Gryphon, Vestar, Wind Point, MSCP, Inflexion, EQT, AIP) focus on platform building, operational improvement, and add-on M&A, often holding for 3–7 years before exiting to strategics or other sponsors.​

PE interest is especially strong in:

Branded pet supplements and premium foods.

Vet-services and clinic roll-ups with potential for private-label nutraceuticals.

Vertically integrated supplement manufacturers (FoodScience-type assets).​



VI.5.1 Buyer typology breakdown (2015–2025 sample of 20+ deals)







Strategic dominance: Corporates drive value (Blue Buffalo USD 8bn, Neovia EUR 1.5bn) via synergies. Mars/Nestlé pay premiums for DTC/subscription (Nom Nom, Tails.com).​

PE platform strategy: Build-then-exit. Gryphon exemplifies: Vetnique platform + Lintbells add-on creates chronic-care powerhouse for strategic sale. Wind Point–MSCP FoodScience chain shows sponsor liquidity.​

Deal flow patterns:

Pet: 70% PE/CVC (high multiples attract sponsors).

Livestock: 80% strategic (commodity risk deters pure PE).

Sponsor exits: 60% to strategics (Zoetis PetMedix, Dechra Invetx), 40% secondary PE.​

Banking playbook: Position pet platforms to PE (Gryphon/Vestar); livestock to strategics (Cargill/ADM); vet adjacencies to large-cap (EQT).





VI.6 Investment themes and opportunities



Valuation uplift drivers:

Clinical differentiation and published data (e.g. YuMOVE, VetriScience, Dasuquin).​

Strong omnichannel reach (DTC + retail + vet).​

Proprietary manufacturing (soft chews, advanced formats).​

Veterinary endorsement and vet-channel distribution.​

Subscription and high repeat-purchase rates.​

Underexplored areas:

Livestock nutraceuticals and AGP alternatives (more strategic than PE-driven due to commodity and regulatory complexity).​

Aquaculture health and ESG-linked ingredients (omega-3, probiotics).​

Data-rich vet and e-commerce platforms as gateways for private-label nutraceuticals.​
