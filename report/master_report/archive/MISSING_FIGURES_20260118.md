# Missing Figures Identification
**Based on Analysis of MAPPING_FIGURES_PLAN_DETAILLE.md**

The following figures have been identified as missing from the current source materials and need to be created to complete the Master White Paper data visualization.

## High Priority
| Section | Figure Description | Source Data Reference |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **I. Definition** | **Venn Diagram: Nutraceuticals vs Supplements vs Additives** | Visualizing the regulatory "grey zone" and overlaps (Plan p.1-2). |
| **II/III. Market** | **Matrix: Species × Functional Needs** | Cross-referencing species specificities with functional categories (e.g., Mobility for Dogs vs. Gut Health for Swine). |
| **I.2 Regulatory** | **Comparative Table: USA vs EU Regulatory Framework** | Highlighting key differences (e.g., Feed vs. Drug binary in US vs. Zootechnical category in EU). |
| **V. Investment** | **Opportunity Matrix (Attractiveness vs Risk)** | Plotting segments based on growth/margin potential vs. regulatory/scientific risk. |
| **V. Investment** | **Risk Heatmap** | Visualizing Regulatory, Scientific, and Commercial risks across regions/categories. |

## Medium Priority
| Section | Figure Description | Source Data Reference |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **II. Segmentation**| **Efficacy Matrix by Ingredient** | Grading ingredients (Glucosamine, Omega-3, Probiotics) by level of clinical evidence (A/B/C). |
| **III. Trends** | **Timeline: Antibiotic Reduction Mandates** | Visualizing the history of AGP bans (EU 2006, US 2017) driving the "Post-Antibiotic" era. |
