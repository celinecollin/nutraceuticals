## Sheet: Regulatory

| **Topic** | **United States (US)** | **European Union (EU)** | **United Kingdom (UK)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Is “nutraceutical” a legal category? | No. FDA does not recognize a “dietary supplement” category for animals; products are regulated as animal food or animal drugs, depending on intended use. | No. Products fall under feed law or veterinary medicinal product law (binary logic). | No. Same binary logic: feed vs veterinary medicine, assessed by presentation and function. |
| Primary authorities | FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for animal food and animal drugs; states enforce feed laws (often via AAFCO-aligned frameworks). | European Commission (authorisations) + EFSA (scientific risk assessment for additives); Member States enforce. | VMD for veterinary medicines; FSA/FSS for feed additives and feed safety (GB). NI has additional complexity due to EU alignment in parts of veterinary medicines. |
| Core legal split (what triggers “drug”) | Intended use / claims. If a product is intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, it is an animal drug under the FD&C Act logic; “support/maintain” claims are typically used for food positioning. | Medicinal claims trigger reclassification as a Veterinary Medicinal Product under the EU medicines framework (and enforcement practice). | Medicinal by presentation (claims imply treat/prevent disease) or medicinal by function (pharmacological effect) triggers VMD control and marketing authorisation requirements. |
| Pre-market route for ingredients | Ingredient must be lawful for use in animal food (common pathways include GRAS, food additive approval; FDA also operates consultation mechanisms for animal food ingredients). | Feed additives require an EU authorisation dossier and EFSA assessment (safety + efficacy depending on category). Feed materials follow different rules than additives. | Feed additives are assessed under UK processes (GB) via FSA/FSS; medicinal products require VMD marketing authorisation (GB). |
| “Performance / functional” claims in production animals | Historically constrained because many performance-type claims drift toward “drug intent.” A key policy debate is creating a clearer path for “zootechnical” type substances as food additives. | Explicitly structured via zootechnical additives under Reg. (EC) No 1831/2003, requiring EFSA review and authorisation (including efficacy). | Similar conceptually to EU for feed additives (GB), with national process; claims still must stay out of “medicinal” territory unless authorised as a medicine. |
| Claims regime in pets (typical market practice) | Many pet supplement players use structure/function style language (support, maintain, promote). No DSHEA-like animal supplement regime. | Disease claims are generally prohibited for feed; functional claims need substantiation; a specific dietetic framework exists for certain “particular nutritional purposes.” | Same as EU logic; VMD is strict on “medicinal” words/phrases and overall presentation (including websites and testimonials). |
| Diet-disease linkage exceptions | Limited, and highly fact-specific. Veterinary therapeutic diets can be scrutinised if positioned to treat disease (borderline). | Dietetic feed (PARNUTS) provides a “positive list” style route for specific nutritional purposes (limited set of permitted claim-types). | Similar concept exists through feed rules, but interpretation differs; also NI vs GB divergence can create additional compliance friction. |
| Post-market controls (typical) | Enforcement actions for misbranding/adulteration; additional industry self-regulation exists in pet supplements. | Strong feed safety enforcement; for additives, authorisation conditions and post-market obligations can apply. | VMD enforcement for medicines; Trading Standards can also be relevant for misleading claims outside medicines law. |
| Practical implication for go-to-market speed | Pet supplements can scale quickly if positioned as “food” with conservative claims, but the boundary is risk-sensitive (label + marketing). | Additive authorisation can be a high barrier to entry (costly dossier), but once authorised, it can create defensible moats for B2B ingredients. | Potentially agile for certain feed authorisations in GB vs EU, but dual regime issues (NI) can complicate “UK-wide” supply chains. |
| What investors should watch (2024–2026) | Fragmentation and reform debate around ingredient review and a dedicated path for functional animal food substances. | Continued emphasis on safety and substantiation; for livestock/aquaculture additives, environmental assessment expectations can be material. | GB regulatory divergence from EU can create “faster test market” dynamics, but also increases compliance complexity for pan-UK operators. |

| Boswellia and curcumin | Dogs and horses, inflammation support | Adjunct to OA care | Pain and mobility measures | C: plausible anti inflammatory mechanisms, limited robust veterinary RCT base; acceptable as secondary stack ingredient | (Aguado et al., 2021); (Caterino et al., 2021) ; (Stabile et al., 2024) | 5 - 8% | 1 - 2% | $100 - $150 Million |  |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anpario | Mitex | Diatomaceous Earth (Physical Action) | Poultry, Swine | Mechanical Killer: Microscopic shards pierce the insect's waxy exoskeleton, causing dehydration and death. No resistance possible. | Resistance-Proof: Unlike chemicals, mites cannot mutate to survive physical destruction. 98.5% efficacy vs. chemical standard. |
| Bioiberica | Atopivet® | Nucleotides + Hyaluronic Acid | Dogs, Cats | Skin Barrier Reinforcement: Strengthens the physical skin barrier from the inside out, making it harder for allergens/parasites to penetrate. | Systemic Shield: The only oral product proven to thicken the dermal barrier, reducing "entry points" for flea allergy dermatitis. |
| Phytobiotics | Miarom® | Essential Oils (Thyme, Anise, Peppermint) | Poultry, Swine | Repellent Scent: Systemic absorption leads to secretion of repellent volatiles through the skin/pores, making the animal "invisible" or hostile to pests. | Sensory Camouflage: Masks the animal's CO2 and heat signature, confusing parasites before they can attach. |
| Candioli | Acarene Spray | Pyrethrins (Natural) + Piperonyl | Birds, Rabbits | Natural Neurotoxin: Uses natural Chrysanthemum extract to paralyze mites without the toxicity of synthetic organophosphates. | Safe for Exotics: The standard of care for delicate species (birds/rabbits) where synthetic chemicals are lethal. |
