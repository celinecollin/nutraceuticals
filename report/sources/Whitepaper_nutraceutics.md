II. Market Definition and Scope

II.1. Definitions and terminology

Origins of nutraceuticals. Working definitions for veterinary nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, zootechnical additives.

Nutraceuticals are specially crafted products intended to address particular dietary requirements and promote preventive healthcare. They contain nutrients that support both the prevention and management of certain health conditions, functioning as dietary supplements. The concept of "nutraceutical," introduced by Dr. Stephen De Felice in 1989, merges the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical." These supplements or food-derived ingredients can provide a range of health advantages, notably by helping treat and prevent various diseases.

These are foods or components of foods that deliver a range of health benefits, including aiding in the treatment or prevention of diseases. The field of nutrition science has progressed from simply addressing nutrient deficiencies to focusing on overall human health and the management and prevention of chronic conditions. The terms "nutraceuticals," "food supplements," and "dietary supplements" emerged following the introduction of the concept by Dr. De Felice.

II.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

In scope: functional health products and feed additives with health benefit. Out of scope: pharmaceuticals, commodity feed, pure services.

II.3. Human vs veterinary markets

Differences in physiology, decision making and willingness to pay by species.



III. Functional Segmentation and Use Cases

III.1. Functional segmentation

Joint health. Gut health. Stress and behavior. Dermatology. Immune support. Performance for livestock.

III.2. Species and segment needs

Dogs, cats, horses. Poultry, swine, ruminants, aquaculture.



III.bis. Species Specific Dynamics and Strategic Implications

III.bis.1. Companion animals vs livestock adoption

Companion animals have high willingness to pay and strong vet influence. Livestock adoption is driven by cost per tonne logic and integrator controls. Horses sit between pets and livestock.

III.bis.2. Antibiotic reduction in livestock

Regulation and industry pressure drive nutraceuticals as partial substitutes for antibiotics. Main levers are immune stimulation, microbiome modulation and reduced infections. Fastest growth in poultry then swine then aquaculture then bovines.

III.bis.3. Functional priorities by species

Poultry focus on enzymes, acids, probiotics. Swine focus on weaning and stress. Ruminants focus on rumen protected actives and methane. Beef and veal focus on growth. Aquaculture focus on immunostimulants and microbiome. Pets focus on mobility, anxiety, dermatology and healthy aging. Horses focus on mobility, ulcers and stress.

III.bis.4. Economic constraints

Pets support high margins. Livestock requires low cost and high volume. Horses support premium pricing but remain small. Aquaculture adoption driven by mortality impact.

III.bis.5. Evidence and regulation variability

Companion animals need stronger clinical evidence. Livestock requires compliance with feed additive rules. Aquaculture regulation varies by region.
