# BIS MERGE VI. Notable Transactions and Investment Landscape (2015 to 2025).docx

VI. Notable Transactions and Investment Landscape (2015 to 2025)

This section focuses on transactions that directly shape the veterinary nutraceutical ecosystem and its adjacent profit pools (functional diets, pet specialty retail, veterinary services, and livestock feed additives). The key observation over 2015 to 2025 is that capital has consistently favored two “defensible” models:

Premium, brand-led companion animal platforms (supplements, functional treats, functional diets) that can compound growth through omnichannel distribution and repeated product launches.

Science-led livestock and aquaculture input platforms (enzymes, probiotics, eubiotics, specialty additives) that monetize regulation-driven demand for antibiotic alternatives, efficiency gains, and sustainability outcomes.

At the same time, services and distribution have become core deal arenas because they control demand access (vets, pharmacies, specialty retailers, e-commerce) and provide data and recurring relationships.

Deal tempo and pricing signals (what the market “said” in 2024 to 2025)

In the pet sector broadly, deal flow remained active but pricing reset as rates stayed higher and leverage became more selective. One visible marker: median EV/EBITDA in 1H 2025 declined versus 2024 for both sponsor-backed and strategic deals (Hulett, 2025).

In pet food M&A specifically, 2025 activity stayed meaningful but more selective: 23 transactions in 2025 vs 26 in 2024, with consolidation driven by a few active aggregators (Petfood Industry, 2026). 

In 2024, one market review counted global pet care M&A down from 128 to 96 deals (2023 to 2024), while sponsor-backed acquisitions increased (IMAP, 2025).





Suggested Figure VI.0 (setup chart): “Two-speed deal market”
A dual-axis chart with (1) quarterly/annual deal volume and (2) median EV/EBITDA (sponsor-backed vs strategic) to show “activity holds, pricing resets” (Hulett, 2025; IMAP, 2025).



VI.1 Major M&A and IPO transactions

VI.1.1 Companion animal brands and formats: omnichannel scale

Investment logic: The highest-priced assets tend to be those that combine (a) brand strength, (b) repeat purchase frequency, and (c) format control (notably soft chews, dental, and treat-like delivery systems). This is why many buyers underwrite these platforms more like consumer brands than classical animal-health manufacturers.

Landmark transactions anchoring the category

General Mills / Blue Buffalo (2018): the landmark “strategic re-rating” deal that validated premium pet nutrition as a consumer-staples growth engine (General Mills, 2018; Investopedia, 2025). 

H&H Group / Zesty Paws (2021): a frequently cited benchmark for premium supplement exits, illustrating the willingness to pay for growth platforms in supplements (Pet Age, 2023).

Swedencare / NaturVet (2022): disclosed economics explicitly framed around premium format economics, with the announcement highlighting an operational EBITDA multiple of 21.4x (Swedencare, 2022).

PetIQ take-private by Bansk Group (2024): illustrates continued sponsor appetite for scaled “pet health and wellness” portfolios even as pricing became more disciplined (PetIQ, 2024; Private Equity Professional, 2024).

General Mills / Whitebridge Pet Brands North America (announced 2024): announced at $1.45bn, adding premium brands such as Tiki Pets and Cloud Star (Reuters, 2024; General Mills, 2024). 

2024 to 2025: “measured” but still consolidating
A sector tracker highlighted that pet food M&A continued in 2025, but with a more cautious tone and a greater share of add-ons and targeted strategic moves rather than mega-deals (Petfood Industry, 2026). 

Suggested Figure VI.1: Companion “format premium” map
Scatter plot of selected companion deals: x-axis = revenue scale (or estimated retail sales), y-axis = EV/EBITDA (when disclosed), markers by format mix (soft chew, dental, functional diet, treats). Use NaturVet (multiple disclosed), PetIQ (multiple disclosed in deal commentary), plus strategic benchmarks (Blue Buffalo, Whitebridge). 



VI.1.2 Strategic acquisitions by large consumer and animal-health players

Investment logic: Strategics increasingly buy (or build) nutraceutical adjacency to (1) lock in consumer demand earlier in the care pathway, (2) increase share of wallet in preventive health, and (3) own the “claims narrative” through science-backed positioning.

Two important patterns emerged:

Consumer strategics (food and FMCG) buying premium pet platforms to diversify growth and margin pools (Reuters, 2024). 

Animal-health and distribution strategics seeking broader portfolios that capture both prescription and non-prescription spend, often via services or channel control (Hulett, 2025).

Suggested Figure VI.2: “Continuum of care” transaction logic
A simple flow diagram showing how strategics expand from food → supplements → veterinary services → prescriptions, annotated with emblematic deals (Blue Buffalo, Whitebridge, distributor and clinic roll-ups). 



VI.1.3 Livestock and aquaculture: specialty feed additives and functional inputs

Investment logic: Consolidation concentrates around proprietary biology and regulatory-enabled demand: enzymes, microbial solutions, and eubiotics positioned as antibiotic alternatives, performance tools, and sustainability enablers.

Key reference transactions

ADM / Neovia (2018): a large-scale nutrition consolidation deal in animal nutrition, disclosed at €1.535bn (ADM, 2018). 

DSM / Erber Group (2020): disclosed at €980m, reinforcing the “science + additives” consolidation pathway (DSM, 2020). 

Phibro / Zoetis medicated feed additive portfolio (2024): $350m purchase price for a portfolio transfer that underlines how “functional inputs” and regulated feed additives can move between large platforms (Zoetis/Phibro deal reporting, 2024). 

Novonesis / dsm-firmenich Feed Enzyme Alliance stake (2025): €1.5bn for a stake increase, signaling continued strategic value placed on enzyme scale and IP (Novonesis, 2025). 

Suggested Figure VI.3: Feed additive consolidation timeline (2015 to 2025)
A horizontal timeline with “deal bubbles” sized by disclosed enterprise value, grouped by modality (enzymes, probiotics, premix/nutrition platforms, regulated feed additives). 



VI.1.4 Upstream functional ingredients: omega-3, fermentation, and sustainable supply

Investment logic: Upstream inputs matter because they determine cost, claims integrity, and supply reliability for downstream nutraceutical brands.

A key example is the continued financial interest in marine and alternative functional lipid supply:

Aker BioMarine Feed Ingredients business sale (2024): reported at $590m enterprise value, illustrating that upstream bioactive supply can command scaled-asset pricing when supply chains are defensible (Aker BioMarine, 2024).

Suggested Figure VI.4: “Bioactive supply stack”
A value-chain schematic from raw material origin (marine, algae, fermentation) → ingredient processing → premix/formulation → brand formats. Annotate where consolidation has occurred (upstream ingredient carve-outs vs downstream brand roll-ups).



VI.1.5 Services, distribution, and retail: controlling access to demand

This layer is crucial for nutraceutical monetization because it determines recommendation power (vets), shelf placement (specialty retail), and repeat purchase mechanics (online subscriptions and pharmacy replenishment).

Veterinary clinic roll-ups and recapitalizations

In late 2024, PE-backed consolidation reached a new scale marker with the announced combination of two large US veterinary groups, described as valued at $8.6bn with $580m annual EBITDA and 750+ locations (Financial Times, 2024; Reuters, 2024). 

In Europe, continued portfolio reshaping is visible in practice divestments and transactions involving IVC Evidensia assets (Lincoln International, 2023). 

CVS activity illustrates ongoing bolt-on logic in veterinary services outside the UK core market as well (CVS Group, 2025).

Distribution and retail consolidation

Patterson Companies acquired by Patient Square Capital (2025) at $4.1bn, showing how distribution platforms remain attractive because they sit at the intersection of prescription products, consumables, and adjacent wellness categories (Hulett, 2025).

Zooplus buyout (2021) with a stated fully diluted equity valuation of approximately €3.7bn at €480 per share, marking the strategic value placed on European pet e-commerce demand capture (zooplus press release, 2021; Reuters, 2021). 

Brazil retail consolidation: the Petz and Cobasi transaction faced competition remedies including a requirement to divest stores (CADE decision reporting; Reuters).

Suggested Figure VI.5: “Control points” of nutraceutical demand
A “channel control” diagram quantifying where nutraceutical purchase decisions are triggered (vet recommendation, retailer shelf, e-commerce subscription). Overlay recent service and distribution deals (SVP/Mission, Patterson, Zooplus, Brazil retail). 



VI.2 Venture capital and private equity: sponsors, platforms, and add-ons

What sponsors are underwriting

Buy-and-build economics remain central. One market review highlights sponsor-backed acquisition momentum even as overall deal counts softened (IMAP, 2025).

Another market update describes continued PE add-on intensity in 2025, with sector activity supported by recurring demand and fragmentation (Capstone, 2025).

Geographic breadth

APAC: growth capital has targeted Chinese premium pet food as a structural growth theme; one investment announcement referenced China’s pet food market at RMB 69bn in 2023 (Advent, 2024).

LATAM: consolidation in Brazil’s pet retail demonstrates that antitrust and market structure increasingly matter to exit paths (CADE; Reuters).

Suggested Figure VI.6: Sponsor vs strategic deal mix
Stacked bars by year: sponsor-backed vs strategic share, and average/median multiples where available (IMAP, 2025; Hulett, 2025).



VI.3 Selected deal table (2015 to 2025)

Below is a practical “copy-paste” deal list focused on transactions that are either (a) nutraceutical/supplement relevant, or (b) directly adjacent profit pools that determine distribution and value capture.

Notes: Where pricing is “undisclosed”, the deal is still included because it materially affects platform consolidation and future exit optionality.



VI.4 Valuation benchmarks and market signals

VI.4.1 Multiples moved down, not out (2024 to 2025)

A pet-sector update reported that in 1H 2025:

Sponsor-backed median EV/EBITDA: 12.2x (vs 16.8x in 2024)

Strategic median EV/EBITDA: 8.1x (vs 13.0x in 2024)

Median EV/Revenue: 2.13x (for the referenced deal set)

Deal volume and capital deployed remained meaningful (Hulett, 2025).

Interpretation for investors: pricing compression is consistent with higher discount rates, but sponsor appetite remains strong for scaled platforms with repeatable add-on pathways.

VI.4.2 Summary ranges by segment (practical underwriting grid)

Below is a pragmatic summary of what “clears” in-market, grounded in disclosed benchmark transactions and sector trackers.

Suggested Figure VI.7: “Multiples ladder”
A bar chart with the segment bands above, plus callouts of the best-known disclosed anchors (NaturVet, SVP/Mission implied multiple, sponsor median 1H 2025). 



VI.5 Current deal mechanics that repeat (what to expect in diligence)

Add-on density beats single-asset brilliance
Roll-up platforms in pet food and pet care continued to accumulate assets via repeated bolt-ons, often across countries (Petfood Industry, 2026; IMAP, 2025). 

Channel control is increasingly a de-risking tool
Services and distribution deals (clinics, pharmacies, distributors) are not “adjacent”. They are often a direct path to stabilizing demand capture for wellness products (Hulett, 2025).

Antitrust and remedies matter more as national champions form
The Brazil retail case illustrates how remedies (store divestments) can change synergy assumptions and integration plans (CADE; Reuters).



VI.6 Reality check: not all stories work (distress and execution risk)

A finance-facing whitepaper benefits from acknowledging that “premium narratives” do not guarantee survivability. In the DTC and alternative formats ecosystem, some assets have faced restructuring and bankruptcy, illustrating that customer acquisition costs, supply chain complexity, and brand differentiation remain critical underwriting variables (e.g., Wild Earth Chapter 11 reporting).

Suggested Figure VI.8: “When models break”
A 2x2 showing (1) CAC intensity and (2) gross margin resilience, mapping which submodels are most exposed during cost-of-capital upcycles.
