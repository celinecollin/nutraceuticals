# Margin_Nutraceuticals.docx

1. Overall market sizes (context)

Global animal health market (drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, nutrition): about USD 62.9 bn in 2024, with ~10–11 % CAGR expected to 2030. Grand View Research+1

Veterinary nutraceuticals specifically: estimates vary by source and perimeter; recent reports put it between USD 2.2–2.9 bn in 2024, with ~7–9 % CAGR projected to 2030+. Intel Market Research+1

Pet nutraceuticals (companion animals only) are usually estimated around USD 5–6 bn mid-2020s. Mordor Intelligence

So nutraceuticals are a small but fast‐growing slice of a ~60+ bn animal health space, and heavily skewed toward companion animals.



2. Margin structure by value-chain segment

2.1. Upstream ingredients & feed additives (“The Origin”)

Representative companies

DSM-Firmenich (group) – nutrition, health and beauty, including animal nutrition

2024 sales: €12.8 bn

Adjusted EBITDA: €2.12 bn, margin 16.5 %.

Evonik Nutrition & Care (segment) – amino acids, probiotics, specialty feed ingredients

2024 sales: €3.76 bn

Adjusted EBITDA: €0.62 bn, margin 16.4 %.

Balchem (group) – specialty minerals, choline, encapsulated nutrients (significant ANH exposure)

2024 sales: USD 954 m

Adjusted EBITDA: USD 250 m, margin 26.3 %.

Nutreco (group, private) – animal nutrition & aqua feed

Group revenue reported around USD 9.44 bn in 2023; SHV notes EBITDA from operational groups (incl. Nutreco) totaling €1.6 bn, i.e. low- to mid-teens margin overall. Abistem

What this tells you

Upstream ingredient producers typically run mid-teens to mid-20s EBITDA margins.

Balchem is closer to the high end (mid-20s), large diversified groups around 16–18 %.

These are capital intensive but IP-rich businesses with decent pricing power once an ingredient is authorized and embedded in premix / feed formulations.

Rule of thumb for your slide

Origin / ingredients:

Revenue scale per player: hundreds of millions to low tens of billions.

EBITDA margins: roughly 15–25 %, sometimes higher for niche specialty players.



2.2. Premix, feed & co-manufacturing (“The Middlemen”)

Representative companies

ForFarmers (public premix/feed)

2024 revenue: €2.75 bn

Underlying EBITDA: €100.8 m, margin 3.7 %. d3bozysj9qkbnw.cloudfront.net

Ridley Corporation (ASX: RIC) – Australian feeds & ingredients

LTM revenue (2025): ~AUD 1.2 bn

LTM EBITDA: AUD 81.7 m, margin ~6.8 %. zionmarketresearch.com+1

BRF (integrated meat + feed + processed foods)

2024 net revenue: R$61.4 bn

EBITDA: R$10.5 bn, margin 17.4 % – but this is the entire food company, not pure premix. Spherical Insights+1

Tyson Foods (integrated meat, big internal feed operations)

2024 sales: USD 53.3 bn

Adjusted operating margin: 3.4 %. Dataintelo

What this tells you

Classical premix/feed mills like ForFarmers operate on very low EBITDA margins (3–5 %), occasionally approaching 7 % in good years (Ridley).

Integrated meat companies that also own large feed operations (Tyson, BRF) can show higher group EBITDA margins (high single digit to mid-teens), but that includes downstream processing and branded food, not just feed.

Rule of thumb

Middlemen / premix & feed:

Revenue scale per platform: often €1–3 bn (ForFarmers, Ridley) up to €9–10 bn (Nutreco).

EBITDA margins: typically 3–7 %.

It is a volume game with limited pricing power, except on highly specialized value-added premix.



2.3. Final products – pet nutraceutical brands & functional pet food

2.3.1. Pet nutraceutical “pure plays”

Swedencare (pet supplements platform; Zesty Paws, NutriScience, etc.)

2024 net revenue: 1.228 bn SEK

Operational EBITDA: 279.7 m SEK, margin 22.8 %. Abistem

Reiterated target to reach 4 bn SEK sales in 2026 with EBITDA margin “exceeding 30 %”. DataM Intelligence

Zesty Paws (standalone, before sale to H&H)

2020 revenue: USD 73.1 m

EBITDA: USD 17.2 m, margin ~23.5 %. Market Intel

Implication

Leading pet supplement brands run ~20–25 % EBITDA margins, with some platforms targeting 30 %+ once scaled.

Gross margins are often 60–70 %, but heavy marketing and DTC CAC bring EBITDA back to the 20s.

2.3.2. Pet food and “functional diets”

Nestlé Group (Purina PetCare is one of the most profitable segments)

2024 group sales: CHF 91.4 bn

Trading operating profit: CHF 14.6 bn, margin 16.0 %; PetCare is one of the segments driving this margin. Mordor Intelligence+1

Public disclosures suggest big pet food businesses (Purina, Mars Petcare, Hill’s, Blue Buffalo, etc.) sit around mid-to-high teens trading / EBITDA margins, sometimes higher for premium or fresh players.

Rule of thumb

Final products – pet supplements: EBITDA 20–25 %, gross margins 60–70 %, revenue per brand from tens of millions to a few hundred million.

Final products – functional pet food: segment EBITDA mid-teens, with the large global players (Purina, Mars) at multi-billion revenue scale.



2.4. Final products – veterinary pharma with nutraceutical lines

Representative companies

Zoetis (NYS: ZTS) – leading global animal health company

2024 revenue: USD 9.256 bn

Net income: USD 2.486 bn (net margin ~27 %).

Elanco Animal Health (NYSE: ELAN)

2024 revenue: USD 4.44 bn

Adjusted EBITDA: USD 910 m, margin 20.5 %.

Takeaways

Large vet pharma businesses run 20–30 %+ EBITDA-equivalent margins, substantially higher than feed and distribution.

Their portfolios are mostly drugs and vaccines, but a non-trivial part of revenue (especially in dermatology, mobility, derm/calm, GI) overlaps with your “nutraceutical” concept via non prescription lines.

For your model, you can treat them as:

High-margin, capital-intensive “strategic buyers” of nutra assets,

Not as pure nutraceutical plays but very relevant for exits.



2.5. Distribution & ecommerce

Representative companies

Chewy (online pet retailer)

2024 net sales: USD 11.86 bn

Adjusted EBITDA: USD 570.5 m, margin 4.8 %.

Petco Health & Wellness

2024 net revenue: USD 6.1 bn

Adjusted EBITDA: USD 96.1 m, margin ~1.6 %. Spherical Insights

Implication

Large omnichannel / retail platforms are low-margin businesses:

Gross margin around 35–40 %,

Adjusted EBITDA margin 2–6 % depending on mix and leverage.

Rule of thumb

Distribution & retail:

Revenue scale: multi-billion.

EBITDA margins: typically 3–6 % online, 1–5 % in brick-and-mortar and vet distribution.

They control access to the end-customer but do not capture most of the economic rent per unit.



3. Distilled margin picture by actor type

Putting this together into a quick reference grid:



4. How to use this in your thesis

When you model value capture per €100 of consumer spend, you can roughly allocate:

10–20 € to ingredients & additives;

5–10 € to premix/feed transformation;

40–50 € to the brand owner (final product);

20–30 € to distribution/retail;
knowing that the highest EBITDA margins sit with:

premium ingredients,

pet supplement brands,

and vet pharma.

Low-margin but strategic parts of the chain (premix/co-manufacturing, ecommerce) are more platform / roll-up plays than pure margin plays.



Overall market context



Global veterinary nutraceuticals (narrow definition: supplements and functional products for animals) are estimated around 2.2–2.9 bn USD in 2024 depending on source, with some reports projecting growth to 6.4 bn USD by 2033 at roughly 9 % CAGR.
The broader pet nutraceuticals segment alone is expected to be 5.84 bn USD in 2025, growing to 8.42 bn USD by 2030 (CAGR 7.6 %).
By contrast, the global animal feed additives market (which is the main upstream “Origin” pool feeding into nutraceutical usage) is estimated around 25–43 bn USD in 2024, depending on methodology.
So your nutraceutical thesis is sitting inside a 40+ bn USD feed additive universe and a 60+ bn USD animal health universe, but the “visible" vet nutraceutical slice is still small, which explains both growth and fragmentation.



The Origin – ingredients and feed additives



2.1 Revenue pools
Global animal feed additives market: about 25–43 bn USD in 2024 with mid single digit CAGR.
Only part of this is directly relevant to “health” (probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, phytogenics, omega 3, specialty minerals), but for revenue modeling you can think of a 10–20 bn USD “health related” subset.
Representative players:
• DSM Firmenich: net sales 12.8 bn EUR, adjusted EBITDA 2.12 bn EUR, margin 16.5 %.
• Evonik Nutrition & Care segment: sales 3.76 bn EUR, adjusted EBITDA 0.62 bn EUR, margin 16.4 %.
• Balchem: net sales 953.7 m USD, adjusted EBITDA 250.3 m USD, margin 26.3 %.
2.2 Margin logic
Ingredient players have:
• High fixed assets (plants, fermentation, R&D) but also high barriers to entry.
• Regulatory moats once an additive is authorised (especially in EU under Reg 1831/2003).
• Significant pricing power for differentiated actives (novel probiotics, algae, insect proteins, collagen/UC II style ingredients).
As a result:
• EBITDA margins are typically 15–25 % at the segment or group level, with specialty players like Balchem in the mid 20s.
• Revenue per “serious” player is in the 0.5–5 bn range, with a few giants above that (DSM, BASF, Evonik).
Scheme idea 1:
• X axis = EBITDA margin, Y axis = revenue, bubbles = representative ingredient players (DSM, Evonik, Balchem, Kemin, Chr Hansen, etc.).
• Shows “fat, high margin bubbles” up in the left of your chain.



The Middlemen – premix, feed and co manufacturing



3.1 Revenue pools
The global compound feed market is >500 bn USD, but nutraceutical relevance is via:
• Premix and specialty feeds used as carriers of the additives above.
• Pet food co manufacturing and private label where value added functional formulas are produced.
Representative financials:
• ForFarmers (European feed/premix)
Revenue 2024: 2.75 bn EUR, underlying EBITDA 100.8 m EUR, margin 3.7 %.
• Ridley (Australian feed)
LTM revenue approx 1.2 bn AUD, EBITDA 81.7 m AUD, margin 6.8 %.
• Nutreco (private)
Revenue around 9.4 bn USD in 2023 across animal nutrition and aqua feed; group EBITDA for SHV operational businesses around 1.6 bn EUR, implying low to mid teens EBITDA combined but much lower specifically in feed.
3.2 Margin logic
• Commodity exposure to grains and oilseeds compresses margins.
• High volume, low differentiation in basic feeds, with some uplift on specialty premixes and health packs.
• Capex heavy (mills) and working capital heavy (raw materials).
Result:
• EBITDA margins typically 3–7 %, even for good operators; net margins often around 1–3 %.
• There is real scale but limited economic rent per unit.
For pet food co manufacturing and private label (Alphia, Red Collar, United Petfood, Partner in Pet Food), margins are often a bit higher than commodity feed but still closer to an industrial contract manufacturing profile than to brand margins: high single digit EBITDA at best, from industry commentary and limited disclosures.
Scheme idea 2:
• Bar chart “EBITDA margin by layer” where the premix/feed bar is a thin 3–7 % strip between Origin (~20 %) and Final product (~20–25 %).
• Overlay a second series with “capital intensity” (high for feed) to show unattractive ROIC unless you are a consolider.



Final products – brands and vet pharma



4.1 Pet nutraceutical brands (supplements)
Market sizing:
• Pet nutraceuticals expected at 5.84 bn USD in 2025, growing to 8.42 bn USD by 2030 with 7.6 % CAGR.
Company examples:
• Swedencare
Net revenue 2024: 630.5 m SEK (mid year) and full year around 1.26 bn SEK. Operational EBITDA margin ~22 % (21–23 % throughout 2024).
• Zesty Paws (pre acquisition by H&H)
2020 revenue 73.1 m USD, net profit after tax just under 13 m USD (~17 % net margin). Analyses by S&P place EBITDA margin around 18–20 %.
Characteristics:
• Gross margins: often 60–70 % (high value ingredients, small pack sizes). Swedencare reports operational gross margin ~58 %.
• Heavy spend on marketing, DTC CAC, and vet detailing, which brings EBITDA down to 20–25 %.
• Low capex, relatively asset light except for inventory and some manufacturing capacity.
So at the “Final product Nutra brand” level:
• For each 100 units of net sales, about 60 go to COGS and overhead, leaving 20–25 as EBITDA in a well run platform.
4.2 Functional pet food
Pet nutraceuticals are often embedded into premium diets.
• Nestlé Group (Purina PetCare segment)
Group sales 2024: 91.4 bn CHF, trading operating profit 14.6 bn CHF (16 %). PetCare is cited as one of the highest margin segments; while Nestlé does not disclose exact segment margins, broker analyses consistently rank PetCare above the group average, so typically high teens EBIT for that segment.
Implications:
• Functional diets and therapeutic pet food capture margins in the mid-teens at scale, higher for the most premium fresh DTC plays (The Farmer’s Dog, Butternut Box) that run more like high growth consumer brands.
4.3 Vet pharma portfolios with nutraceutical lines
They are not nutraceutical pure plays but are important for exits.
• Zoetis
2024 revenue 9.256 bn USD; net income 2.486 bn USD, net margin ~27 %.
• Elanco
2024 revenue 4.44 bn USD; adjusted EBITDA 910 m USD, margin 20.5 %.
These margins reflect drug portfolios, but:
• Nutraceutical and non medicinal lines are often used as lifecycle extensions for key franchises (derm, GI, joint).
• From an acquisition standpoint, they are the buyers willing to pay higher multiples for strong brands or differentiated ingredients.

Scheme idea 3:
• Bubble chart for “Final products” with X axis = product type (supplement brand, functional diet, vet pharma), Y axis = EBITDA margin, bubble size = revenue. Shows small but highly profitable supplement brands, huge but mid margin pet food, and huge and very profitable vet pharma.



Distribution and ecommerce



5.1 Ecommerce / retail
Examples:
• Chewy
2024 net sales 11.86 bn USD; adjusted EBITDA 570.5 m USD, margin 4.8 %.
• Petco
2024 net revenue 6.1 bn USD; adjusted EBITDA ~96 m USD, margin ~1.6 %.
Vet distributors (Henry Schein, Covetrus, MWI) are often around 5–10 % EBITDA on distribution operations, but detailed pet-only numbers are limited and vary by business mix.
5.2 Margin logic
• Retail and ecommerce capture a large share of the consumer price (trade margin, logistics, customer acquisition) but keep only 2–6 % as EBITDA.
• They benefit from scale and customer data rather than per unit margin.
Scheme idea 4:
• Sankey diagram from consumer price to profits:

Show 100 entering at the consumer, flows out to Revenue at each layer; thickness proportional to share.

Overlay small “profit bars” at each node (Origin 3–5, Middlemen <1, Final product 7–12, Distribution 1–2).



Integrating everything in one narrative



If you want to narrate this in your report or deck, you can literally say:
• Globally, feed additives represent a 25–43 bn USD B2B revenue pool serving as the upstream “engine” of animal nutraceuticals, with EBITDA typically around 20 %.
• Premix and feed manufacturers carry those actives into the diet, but earn only 3–7 % margins on huge volumes, making them primarily platform or logistics plays.
• The visible veterinary nutraceutical market itself is only 2–3 bn USD today, but overlapping with a pet nutraceutical space of around 6 bn and growing high single digits.
• Within that, pet supplement brands can sustain 20–25 % EBITDA margins on tens to hundreds of millions of revenue, which is why they trade at high multiples and are attractive bolt ons for pet giants and vet pharma.
• Functional pet food and vet pharma play at a bigger scale and slightly lower or higher margins respectively, acting as the natural consolidators for successful nutraceutical concepts.
• Distribution platforms like Chewy absorb a big slice of the consumer spend but capture thin EBITDA, making them crucial gatekeepers but less compelling from a pure margin capture perspective.
If you want, I can now draft a 2–3 page written section called “Economics of the animal nutraceutical value chain” that you can paste as is into the market report, using these numbers and the scheme ideas above.
