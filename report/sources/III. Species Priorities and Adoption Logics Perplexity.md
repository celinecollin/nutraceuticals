III. Species Priorities and Adoption Logics



Investment Framework

The veterinary nutraceutical market is most usefully segmented by species from a capital allocation perspective, as adoption drivers, regulatory constraints, and monetisation pathways vary materially between companion animals and production systems. Companion demand reflects owner willingness to pay for chronic care and quality-of-life outcomes, with brand and format as key differentiators. Production systems prioritise measurable ROI, productivity, and compliance with antimicrobial and environmental mandates, emphasising efficacy and feed integration.​



III.1 Companion Animals (Dogs and Cats)



Market scale

Europe hosts 282 million pets (90M dogs, 108M cats); the US pet economy reached USD 151.9bn in 2024 spend (USD 39.8bn veterinary care/products), with 94M households owning pets (68M dog, 49M cat).​



Adoption drivers

Chronic, non-curative conditions drive recurring spend:

Musculoskeletal aging: ~20% dogs >1yr, up to ~80% >8yrs (referral/radiographic data).​

Cognitive aging: 14–35% dogs >8yrs, rising further.​



Format economics

Chewables/soft chews command ~39% share (2024), rising with launches; dogs ~77% of category.​

Investment lens. Scalable models combine repeat categories (mobility, gut, calming), high-compliance formats, and frictionless distribution (e.g. e-commerce/subscription), underpinning high-teens to low-20s EBITDA multiples in premium transactions.​

III.2 Horses (Equine)



Market scale

US: 2M households with horse ownership—a high-ARPU niche despite smaller headcount.​



Adoption drivers

Performance, musculoskeletal wear, gastric sensitivity, and competition management; powders/pellets integrate into stable routines with high efficacy expectations.

Link to Part II. Aligns with joint health and calming functions, offering drug-sparing for NSAIDs in chronic wear.



Investment lens

Suited for specialist brands and DTC/vet distribution; a high ARPU niche rather than broad platforms, with premium pricing on evidence-backed performance claims.​

III.3 Livestock



Market scale

Global feed production: 1.396bn metric tons (2024); poultry 42.7% tonnage.​



Adoption drivers

Productivity: FCR, ADG, mortality, uniformity.

Health risk: gut stability (weaning, heat stress).

Regulatory: antimicrobial stewardship, emissions targets.



Regulatory catalysts.

EU: 50% antimicrobial sales cut by 2030.​

US: 2022 sales down 36% vs 2015 peak.​

UK: zinc oxide withdrawal (June 2022).​

EU bacteriophages authorised (2025).​



Macro tailwind

Animal protein output +17% (2025–2034).​

Reinforces gut, immunity, performance as antibiotic-alternative infrastructure.



Investment lens

Volume-driven, lower multiples (10–15x) with upside from regulatory tailwinds and feed integration; high-throughput defensibility.​

III.4 Aquaculture



Market scale

130.9M tonnes production (2022); 94.4M tonnes aquatic animals (51% total supply)—surpassed capture fisheries.​



Adoption drivers

High density/biological risk amplifies FCR/survival sensitivity; feed-channel deployment at scale.

Strong fit for immunity/gut segments.



Investment lens

Efficacy-led pricing power where performance deltas are measurable at scale; growth engine for functional feeds.​
