Suggested figures for Section III

Figure III.1: Two-speed market map (Value vs volume by species)

What it shows

A bubble chart positioning species by economic logic:

Pets and horses: high value per animal, brand and compliance-driven

Livestock and aquaculture: high volume, ROI and biological efficiency-driven

How to plot

X-axis: estimated annual spend potential per head (or per “animal unit”)

Y-axis: population or production volume proxy (headcount, output, or feed consumption)

Bubble size: estimated nutraceutical addressable spend

Colors: “Humanization logic” vs “ROI logic”

Financial message

Explains why “pet” can outgrow “farm” in value even if farm dominates in tonnage and why multiples and margins differ structurally.

Data inputs to source later

Species populations (FAOSTAT, USDA, Eurostat; FEDIAF/AVMA for pets)

Spend proxies (APPA, Euromonitor, company disclosures, market reports)



Figure III.2: Species x functional need heatmap (Demand intensity)

What it shows

A heatmap with:

Rows: Mobility, Gut, Immunity, Cognitive aging, Calming, Performance/FCR

Columns: Dogs, Cats, Horses, Poultry, Swine, Ruminants, Aquaculture

Cell color = “relative priority / demand intensity” (Low / Medium / High)

Financial message

Makes the segmentation instantly legible and links each species to the “margin pools” (for example mobility and calming in pets vs gut/performance in production).

Optional upgrade

Add a small icon per cell indicating dominant evidence type:

RCT (pets)

Field trial (production)

Meta-analysis (where available)



Figure III.3: KPI scoreboard (What “works” means by species)

What it shows
A single table-style figure mapping:

Pets: CBPI, activity, owner-reported QoL, adherence/repurchase

Horses: lameness scores, days-in-training, ulcer management endpoints, competition readiness

Poultry/swine: FCR, ADG, mortality, lesion scores, uniformity, treatment incidence

Aquaculture: survival, FCR, disease events, harvest yield, handling stress losses

Financial message

Connects products to measurable outcomes and explains why livestock products sell when they move KPIs by small percentages.



Figure III.4: Format and delivery system by species (The “format constraint” chart)

What it shows
Two stacked bar panels:

Companion animals and equine formats

Soft chews, powders, liquids, pastes, tablets

Production formats

Premix inclusion, feed-integrated powders, microencapsulated actives, water-soluble interventions, boluses (ruminants)

Financial message

Format is a margin driver because it determines compliance, differentiation, and manufacturing complexity.



Figure III.5: Channel map by species (Where the customer sits)

What it shows
A Sankey diagram or layered flow:

Species -> decision maker -> channel

Pets: pet parent -> e-commerce / pet specialty retail / vet clinic

Horses: owner/trainer -> tack shops / specialist e-com / vet direct

Poultry/swine: integrator/nutritionist -> premixers / feed mills / vet supply

Aquaculture: farm manager -> feed company / aqua consultants / local distribution

Financial message

Shows why customer acquisition economics are completely different between DTC pet brands and B2B feed additive players.



Figure III.6: “Stress windows” timeline (Why adoption happens at specific moments)

What it shows
A timeline by species highlighting the biological and operational stress points that trigger spend:

Swine: weaning gap, PRRS risk windows, diet transitions

Poultry: heat stress, coccidiosis/NE risk windows, transport

Ruminants: transition cow period, feed changes, methane-related pressure

Aquaculture: transfer, handling, temperature swings, pathogen outbreaks

Pets: aging curve, chronic conditions onset, behavioral triggers (urban living, separation)

Financial message

Nutraceutical demand in production is episodic but repeatable (linked to predictable stress windows), while pets are more “subscription-like” once a chronic need is established.



Figure III.7: Production ROI bridge (How additives pay back)

What it shows
A waterfall chart for one representative species (then you can replicate later):

Additive cost per ton -> performance deltas -> net margin impact
Example benefit blocks:

FCR improvement

Mortality reduction

Reduced treatment incidence

Improved uniformity / carcass yield

Financial message

Converts biology into unit economics and supports why B2B suppliers defend pricing when ROI is demonstrated.



Figure III.8: Strategic divergence summary (One-slide synthesis)

What it shows
A 2x2 matrix:

X-axis: Buyer logic (Emotion/Quality-of-life -> ROI/Cost-of-production)

Y-axis: Execution model (Brand + compliance -> Technical + integration)
Place:

Dogs/cats (emotion + brand/compliance)

Horses (hybrid)

Swine/poultry (ROI + technical integration)

Aquaculture (ROI + risk mitigation)

Financial message

Makes the section memorable and sets up Part V (competitive landscape) cleanly.









Figure III.1 (Must-have): Species x Functional Priorities heatmap

What it shows
A single-page “map” of which nutraceutical functions matter most by species, and why. This is the cleanest way to make the “segmented adoption logic” immediately obvious.

Best visual format
A heatmap / matrix:

Rows (functional areas): Mobility, Gut/Microbiome, Immunity/Resilience, Calming/Behavior, Cognitive/Aging, Performance-FCR/Growth

Columns (species clusters): Dogs, Cats, Horses, Poultry, Swine, Ruminants, Aquaculture

Cell content (minimal):

Top use case keyword (ex: “OA pain support”, “weaning gap”, “heat stress”, “mortality control”)

A small icon for main KPI:

Pets: validated pain score, activity, QoL

Production: FCR, ADG, mortality, lesion scores

A small tag for dominant delivery (chews vs premix vs water-soluble etc.)

Why it is finance-relevant
It visually proves the market is not “one nutraceutical market”, but a portfolio of species-specific value pools. It also supports your later discussions on margins, channels, and defensibility (B2C recurring vs B2B ROI tools). 

III. Species Priorities and Ado…

Optional enhancement
Add a thin band above each species column with:

“Buying logic”: Emotion/Humanization vs ROI/Efficiency vs Hybrid (horses)
This makes your “two-speed market” argument instantly legible.



Figure III.2 (Must-have): Format and channel “Sankey” (or stacked bars) by species

What it shows
That adoption is not only driven by biology, but by delivery constraints and routes-to-market:

Pets: palatability and owner compliance

Livestock: integration into industrial feeding

Aquaculture: survival risk and feed-system constraints

Best visual format (choose one)

Option A: Sankey (best storytelling)

Species → Delivery format → Main channel

Dogs/Cats → soft chews, powders, liquids → e-commerce, retail, vet

Horses → pellets, oral pastes/syringes → tack shops, vet-direct, specialized e-commerce

Poultry/Swine → premixes, pelleted feed inclusions, water-soluble → integrators, feed mills, premixers

Aquaculture → feed inclusion, water treatment (if relevant) → feed companies, aqua consultants

Option B: Stacked bar charts (best for analysts)

For each species cluster, show two stacked bars:

Formats mix

Channels mix

Why it is finance-relevant
Formats and channels explain:

Who captures margin (DTC brands vs vet channel vs premix suppliers)

Why some categories scale faster (feed-integrated vs owner-administered)

Why switching costs differ (formulation integration and field performance data in B2B)

This figure connects Part III directly to Part V (competitive landscape) and Part VI (transactions). 

III. Species Priorities and Ado…



Figure III.3 (High impact): “Two-speed value pool” bubble chart (Value vs Volume by species)

What it shows
A visual synthesis of your key thesis:

Livestock is volume-driven

Pets are value-driven

Horses often sit in a hybrid premium niche

Aquaculture can be high risk, high ROI depending on system

Best visual format
A bubble scatter plot:

X-axis: Volume proxy

Pets: population (dogs, cats)

Livestock: headcount or feed tonnage by species

Aquaculture: production volume (tons) or feed volume

Y-axis: Value intensity proxy

Average annual spend per animal on nutraceuticals, or

Price per kg and inclusion economics (for feed additives)

Bubble size: Total addressable nutraceutical market for that species cluster (even if indexed)

Color: Buying logic (Emotion vs ROI vs Hybrid)

Why it is finance-relevant
This is the figure that investors remember because it explains, at a glance:

where the largest pools of money are,

where pricing power is structurally higher,

and why “winning” strategies diverge across species. 

III. Species Priorities and Ado…

If you lack perfect data
You can still do this as an indexed chart (index = 100 for the largest segment) and later replace with hard numbers when you finalize your datasets.



If you only pick two

Species x Functional Priorities heatmap (Figure III.1)

Format + channel Sankey/stacked bars (Figure III.2)

If you can afford a third

Add the Two-speed value pool bubble chart (Figure III.3)

If you want, I can also draft the exact labels, legends, and 1-sentence captions under each figure in whitepaper style so you can paste them directly into the document.

11. Figure – Global Pet Nutraceutical / Supplements Market Growth

Goal: Show overall category growth.

Chart type: Line chart (single line).

Title: “Global Pet Nutraceuticals / Supplements Market Size”.

X-axis: Years (for example): 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026 (forecast), 2030 (forecast).

Y-axis: “Market size (USD billions)”. Scale according to source (e.g. 0–12).

Example coherent data choice (pick one source family and stick to it):

2020: ~3.0

2022: ~4.1

2024: ~5.1

2026: ~6.0

2030: ~8.4
(These values should be tuned to match your chosen report; the key is an upward line with mid-single to high-single digit CAGR.)​

How to draw:

Plot each year’s value as a point, connect with straight lines.

Optionally write CAGR (e.g. “~7% CAGR”) in a box on the chart.



12. Figure – Pet vs Livestock Nutraceutical Value Pools (2030E)

Goal: Compare pet vs livestock TAM.

Chart type: Simple side-by-side bar chart.

Title: “Pet vs Livestock Nutraceutical / Probiotics Value Pools (2030E)”.

X-axis (categories):

Pet Nutraceuticals

Animal Probiotics / Feed Probiotics

Y-axis: “Market size (USD billions)”.

Data (order-of-magnitude from reports):​

Pet Nutraceuticals: e.g. 8.5

Animal Probiotics / Feed Probiotics: e.g. 12

How to draw:

Draw two bars; height of each = above values.

Label on top: “USD 8.5B” and “USD 12B”.

Caption can clarify sources/estimates.



13. Figure – Nutraceutical Value Chain (Molecule to Market)

Goal: Show flow and where actors sit.

Chart type: Horizontal process diagram.

Title: “From Molecule to Market: The Veterinary Nutraceutical Value Chain”.

Blocks (left to right):​

Ingredient Supplier

CDMO / Premixer

Brand Owner

Distributor / Channel

End User

Under each block, add text with typical roles and margin bands:

Ingredient Supplier: “Commodities & IP-based actives; ~25–30% EBITDA for branded ingredients”.​

CDMO: “Formulation, extrusion, palatability; ~15–18% EBITDA”.​

Brand Owner: “Positioning, marketing, customer relationship; ~20–25% EBITDA for premium pet brands”.​

Distributor / Channel: “Vet, e-commerce, retail, premix integrators; margin via mark-ups and services”.​

End User: “Pet owner (B2C) or farmer (B2B)”.

How to draw:

Draw rectangles in a row, connected by arrows.

Under each rectangle, place a short bullet list or 1–2 lines.



14. Figure – Waterfall Value Breakdown: Pet vs Livestock Product

Goal: Make per-unit economics visible.

Chart type: Two separate waterfall charts (or side-by-side stacked bars if software is limited).

Title: “Value Capture per USD 50 Product: Pet Supplement vs Livestock Additive”.

Panel A – Pet Supplement:​

Start at 50 (Retail price).

Step 1: subtract COGS 10 → running subtotal 40.

Step 2: subtract Packaging/Logistics 5 → subtotal 35.

Step 3: subtract Marketing/CAC 15 → subtotal 20.

Final bar: “Brand Margin = 20”.

Panel B – Livestock Additive:​

Start at 50 (Price to farmer).

Step 1: subtract Raw Material 25 → subtotal 25.

Step 2: subtract Manufacturing/Blending 10 → subtotal 15.

Step 3: subtract Tech Support/Sales 10 → subtotal 5.

Final bar: “Integrator Margin = 5”.

How to draw (with a waterfall tool):

Specify starting value 50.

Then a sequence of negative contributions (−10, −5, −15 or −25, −10, −10).

Software will show descending bars; last bar is the remaining margin.



15. Figure – Margin vs Market Size by Segment

Goal: Position segment attractiveness.

Chart type: Bubble chart.

Title: “Margin vs Market Size by Segment”.

X-axis: “Approximate market size (USD billions)”.

Range e.g. 0–15.

Y-axis: “EBITDA margin (%)”.

Range 0–35%.

Bubbles to plot (example coordinates):​

Ingredient Suppliers: (market size ~2, margin 28).

Pet Brands: (market size ~5, margin 22).

CDMOs: (market size ~1, margin 18).

Livestock Premixers / Integrators: (market size ~10, margin 10).

How to draw:

Place each bubble at its (x,y) position; give a label next to it (“Ingredient Suppliers”, etc.).

Bubble size can be proportional to revenue or arbitrarily consistent.



16. Figure – Pharma Encroachment Funnel

Goal: Illustrate how nutraceuticals act as a funnel into Rx.

Chart type: Funnel diagram.

Title: “Pharma Encroachment: Nutraceuticals as an Entry Funnel”.

Funnel stages (top to bottom):​

Awareness / trial of nutraceutical (e.g. joint supplement, skin & coat chews).

Regular nutraceutical user (subscriptions, repeat purchases).

Diagnosis of chronic condition (e.g. osteoarthritis, chronic dermatitis).

Prescription drug adoption (NSAIDs, disease-modifying agents) from same corporate group.

How to draw:

Draw a funnel shape (four stacked trapezoids narrowing downward).

Label each layer with the stage above.

On the side, you can add examples: “Zoetis, Elanco” as companies that own both nutraceutical and pharma assets.​
