V. Mapping and Competitive Landscape

V.1 Key Players: Mapping and Portfolio Depth

The veterinary nutraceuticals arena is highly fragmented, but most players fit into four archetypal groups. Below we map the key companies in each category, highlighting their scale (2024–2025 financials where available), strategic focus, and competitive strengths:



Figure V.1 – Competitive Archetypes by Revenue and EBITDA Margin

Data Points: Zoetis, Swedencare, Novonesis, ForFarmers, Nutramax (est.), Aker BioMarine, DSM-Firmenich

Insight: Highlights the two-speed economy (high-margin/low-volume vs. low-margin/high-volume), showing clustering of feed giants at low margin, high revenue, and pet nutraceutical brands in high margin, mid-revenue zone.



V.1.1 The “Big Pharma” Incumbents (Animal Health Divisions)

Zoetis – As the world’s largest stand-alone animal health company, Zoetis generated $9.3 billion in 2024 revenueinvestor.zoetis.com. Its EBITDA margins are among the highest in the industry (operating margins ~38%businessquant.combusinessquant.com), reflecting a portfolio of blockbuster veterinary drugs and vaccines. While pharmaceuticals remain the core, incumbents like Zoetis are encroaching into nutraceuticals. Zoetis acquired Platinum Performance (an equine supplements firm) to expand into nutritional products for horses, and it markets pet wellness products under its Petcare division. These pharma giants leverage extensive R&D and veterinary channel access – Zoetis spent ~$686 million on R&D in 2024summitstocks.substack.com – allowing them to launch nutraceuticals with clinical backing. Global reach (Zoetis sells in 100+ countries) and trusted brands (e.g. Apoquel, Simparica) give them an edge in distribution and credibility.

Merck Animal Health (MSD Animal Health) – The animal health unit of Merck & Co. delivered $5.9 billion sales in 2024merck.com, with balanced exposure to livestock (>$3.4B) and companion animals (~$2.4B)merck.commerck.com. Merck’s portfolio centers on vaccines and parasiticides (e.g. Bravecto flea/tick, a $1.1B productmerck.com), but it has begun investing in nutritional additives. Notably, Merck acquired VB Technologies (aqua feed additives from Elanco) to enter functional feed for aquaculturemerck.com. Merck’s animal division operates at high profitability (segment profit grew 12% in 2024sec.gov), and it benefits from parent Merck’s global infrastructure. Strategic focus includes innovative feed supplements (e.g. for aquaculture health) and leveraging its veterinary network to promote nutraceuticals alongside drugs.

Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health – BI’s animal division (private) had €4.7 billion in 2023 sales (~$5.1B)boehringer-ingelheim.com, growing ~7%. BI leads in parasiticides for pets (Frontline, Heartgard) and swine vaccines. It has started branching into preventative nutritionxc, for example developing gut health solutions for young animals. BI’s strategy emphasizes “one health” – integrating pharma and nutrition – supported by large R&D budgets (group R&D ~22.5% of salesboehringer-ingelheim.com). BI’s global footprint (sales in 150+ markets) and presence in both pets and farm sectors position it to bundle nutraceuticals (like joint supplements or probiotics) with therapeutic offerings, enhancing customer loyalty.

Elanco Animal Health – A former Eli Lilly division, Elanco is now independent (2024 revenue ~$4.5 billion). Elanco has aggressively pursued “nutritional health” products to complement its pharmaceuticalsnationalhogfarmer.com. It offers feed enzymes and probiotics (e.g. Gallipro® line for poultry)my.elanco.com and has partnered on microbiome solutions for swinenationalhogfarmer.com. However, Elanco’s profitability has lagged peers – adjusted EBITDA margins were ~16% in 2024investor.elanco.com – due to acquisition integrations and debt load. This has somewhat constrained R&D investment compared to Zoetis. Still, Elanco’s strategic push is to develop alt-feed additives (like the methane-reducing Bovaer under license) and pet supplements that align with its therapeutic areas. Its global sales force in livestock and relationships with feed integrators are a key competitive strength for distributing new nutritional products at scale.

Mid-Tier Animal Health Firms – Companies like Virbac and Vetoquinol (France) also play in this space. Virbac, a $1 billion+ vet pharma firm, markets pet nutraceuticals (e.g. MOVOFLEX® joint chews) alongside vaccines. Vetoquinol (2024 sales ~€540M) generated €104.3M EBITDA (19.3% margin)live.euronext.comlive.euronext.com and trades at ~7–8× EBITDAvalueinvesting.io – reflecting its smaller scale but steady nutraceutical portfolio (dermatology supplements, etc.). These firms differentiate via innovation in niche products and targeted geographic presence (Virbac is strong in veterinary clinics, Vetoquinol in EU farm markets). In summary, Big Pharma incumbents bring deep pockets, rigorous science, and channel power – increasingly applying these to nutraceuticals through product line extensions and bolt-on acquisitions.

V.1.2 The “Feed & Nutrition” Titans (Livestock Focus)

This archetype includes agribusiness giants and feed additive specialists that dominate production animal nutrition. They drive huge volumes in livestock and aquaculture feeds, often with thin margins but stable demand.

Cargill & ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) – These behemoths (both with total revenues $85–$100B) have sizable animal nutrition arms. ADM’s Animal Nutrition unit grew via the Neovia acquisition and now produces premixes, feed ingredients, and specialty additives. ADM’s Nutrition segment had $668M operating profit in 2022thepoultrysite.com (including human and animal), but faced a dip in 2024 as commodity conditions tightened. ADM is pivoting to higher-margin feed additives – e.g. developing probiotics and enzymes – while leveraging its global grain logistics to supply base feeds cheaply. Cargill, likewise, operates feed mills worldwide and acquired Diamond V (yeast culture supplements) and Delacon (phytogenics) to boost its portfolio of natural additivesglobalpetindustry.com. These titans’ strengths lie in scale and distribution – e.g. Cargill delivers 20 million+ tons of feed annually – and their integration across the value chain (from raw materials to formulated feeds). However, their EBITDA margins are modest (high single digits) given the commodity component of their business.

ForFarmers – A leading European feed producer, ForFarmers had an excellent 2024, increasing EBITDA 44% to €100.8 Mforfarmersgroup.eu. This came on €518M gross profit from ~€2.5–3B in feed sales (implying low teens gross margins)forfarmersgroup.eu. ForFarmers trades around 6–8× EBITDA (enterprise value ~€700M) reflecting its commodity profile. Strategic moves have focused on consolidation for scale (acquisitions in Poland and co-product feed ventures)forfarmersgroup.euforfarmersgroup.eu and sustainability – e.g. shifting to “circular” feeds using by-productsforfarmersgroup.eu. Feed & nutrition specialists like ForFarmers differentiate via on-farm technical support and tailored feed formulations to optimize animal performance. Their competitive strength is in high-volume manufacturing efficiency and longstanding relationships with farmers/integrators. However, to capture more value, these players are increasingly offering value-added nutraceutical additives (enzymes, organic minerals, essential oils) bundled into feeds. Investors still value them like specialty chemical firms – e.g. ForFarmers EV/EBITDA ~7× vs pet brands at double that – due to lower growth and less IP protection.

Alltech (private) – One of the largest nutraceutical-focused feed companies (est. >$800M revenue), Alltech has built its brand on yeast-based supplements, organic minerals, and fermentation products. It remains privately held but is an influential “titan” in livestock nutrition, known for innovative products like Yea-Sacc® (probiotic yeast) and Bio-Mos® (prebiotic MOS). Alltech’s strategy is innovation-driven differentiation: heavy R&D into natural alternatives to antibiotics (they were early in enzymes and algae DHA for feed). Geographic reach is global (present in 120+ countries), with strengths in poultry and ruminant sectors. Alltech’s strong suit is proprietary IP (many patented strain technologies) which allows premium pricing and decent margins compared to commodity feed mills. Similar ethos is seen in DSM-Firmenich (which now encompasses DSM’s feed additive business). DSM developed Bovaer® (a methane-reducing feed additive) and tends to enjoy ~20% EBITDA margins in nutritionmarketscreener.com thanks to its high-tech portfolio. Such companies are trading in the ~10–15× EBITDA range (DSM’s animal nutrition is part of a larger group, but specialty peers like Novozymes/Chr. Hansen historically commanded high-teens multiples due to innovation and patent protection).

Other Notable Players – Nutreco/Trouw Nutrition (private, Netherlands) is a major feed producer with integrator clients worldwide and a strong premix business; AB Agri (part of Associated British Foods) similarly spans feeds and specialty feed enzymes (AB Vista unit). PHIBRO Animal Health (NASDAQ: PAHC) straddles pharma and nutritional specialties (e.g. minerals, immunomodulators) with ~$1B sales – it trades at a modest ~8× EBITDA, reflecting slow growth. Across the board, Feed & Nutrition Titans are investing in “green” nutraceuticals (for emissions reduction, gut health to replace antibiotics) to meet regulators’ and integrators’ demands. Those with proven innovations in this space are seeing a valuation uplift – for instance, IP-driven feed additive businesses can fetch ~12× EBITDA, vs ~6× for commodity feed mills. The two-speed dynamic between these and pet-facing firms (next section) is pronounced.

V.1.3 The “Pure-Play” Consumer Brands (Pet Focus)

This archetype features companies dedicated to companion animal nutraceuticals – often with consumer-friendly branding, DTC sales, and broad retail presence. They are riding the “pet humanization” wave, and many have seen explosive growth and high valuations.

Swedencare AB – A consolidator of pet supplement brands, Swedencare has assembled a global portfolio (brands like NaturVet, ProDen PlaqueOff, NutraVet). In 2024, Swedencare’s revenue was SEK 2.53 billion (~$240M), up 9%, with an EBITDA margin of 22.2%swedencare.com. This is a healthy margin, though slightly below its 30%+ historical targetstorage.mfn.se due to recent integration costs. Swedencare’s strategy emphasizes acquisitions and channel expansion. Its $447.5M purchase of NaturVet (Garmon Corp) in 2022 gave it a major US retail footholdglobalpetindustry.com. Notably, NaturVet had $60.6M sales and $18.9M EBITDA (31% margin) prior to acquisitionglobalpetindustry.com – implying a rich ~7.4× revenue, 23.7× EBITDA deal multiple. This reflects the premium paid for strong brands with high gross margins. Swedencare differentiates via its broad portfolio (dental health, joint, calming, etc.), omnichannel reach (from Chewy/Amazon to vet clinics), and now in-house manufacturing (it acquired Vetio CDMO) to secure supply. The company’s global presence (North America, EU, Asia via partners) and focus on innovation (e.g. soft chew formats, VOHC-approved dental chewsswedencare.com) position it as a leader among pure-plays.

Zesty Paws – Florida-based Zesty Paws exemplifies the DTC-powered pet supplement brand. Known for its flavorful soft chews targeting issues like immunity, hip & joint, and gut health, Zesty Paws grew to $73M revenue and $17M EBITDA in 2020marketscreener.com. It was acquired in 2021 by Health & Happiness (H&H) Group for $610M, an eye-popping valuation (~8× revenue, 35× EBITDA on 2020 figures)marketscreener.commarketscreener.com. This 18–20× EBITDA “pet premium” set a high-water mark for the sector. Zesty Paws’ success lies in savvy digital marketing (top-seller on Amazon in pet supplements), a focus on palatability/compliance (dogs love the chews, driving repeat purchase), and rapid innovation cycles (leveraging human trends like probiotics, superfoods into pet products). Now under H&H, Zesty Paws is expanding internationally (leveraging H&H’s China distributionjust-food.com) and into retail stores. It remains a benchmark for how a pet wellness brand can command tech-like multiples due to its growth profile (sales grew ~+60% CAGR pre-acquisition) and consumer brand strength.

Nutramax Laboratories – A veteran in the space, Nutramax is privately held but widely regarded as the #1 vet-channel supplement company. Its flagship products (Cosequin and Dasuquin for joint health, Denamarin for liver) are backed by clinical studies and heavily recommended by veterinarians. Industry analysts estimate Nutramax’s revenue at >$500M in recent yearsincfact.com, underscoring its scale. The company is family-owned and extremely profitable, reinvesting in research (it often sponsors clinical trials in companion animals) – a strategy yielding strong trust among vets. Nutramax’s strategic positioning is “clinical proof and quality” over flashy marketing. This has made its brands staples in vet clinics and specialty pet retailers. While not publicly traded, Nutramax would likely garner high valuations (comparable to pharma) given its ~20–25% growth during the pet boom and margins rumored to be 30%+. It stands as an example of a “science-first” pure-play – showing that credible efficacy can be as powerful as DTC glitz.

Other Pure-Plays and Brands – The category is crowded with entrants, but a few more stand out:

YuMOVE (Lintbells) – A UK-based joint supplement brand (glucosamine/chondroitin blends with clinical backing) that grew revenues from £12M in 2018 to ~£46M in 2021preqin.com (46% CAGR). YuMOVE pioneered a subscription model for dog joint chews, boasting high loyalty. Its parent Lintbells was sold by PE firm Inflexion in 2021, reportedly delivering a 5.5× returnpreqin.com – indicating a rich revenue multiple near that of tech firms. YuMOVE’s success underscores the value of recurring revenue models (often valued like SaaS, given predictable cashflows) and multi-channel presence (strong DTC and entry into U.S. vet clinics).

Pet Honesty – A fast-growing U.S. brand (focus on natural ingredient soft chews) that received a majority investment from Vestar Capital in 2021vestarcapital.com. Pet Honesty’s strategy is premium positioning (no artificials, vet-formulated) and expansion into brick & mortar (e.g. Petco). It exemplifies PE interest in the space – Vestar’s backing aimed to fuel omnichannel growthpetage.com. Similarly, VetriScience (owned by FoodScience Corp) was acquired by Wind Point Partners in 2022businesswire.com, and Grizzly Pet Products (fish oil supplements) was bought by Whitebridge Pet. These deals typically came at double-digit EBITDA multiples, reflecting growth expectations.

Manna Pro (Compana) – Backed by Carlyle, Manna Pro has rolled up legacy supplement brands (Nutri-Vet, Vet’s Best, etc.) in addition to treats and horse supplements. It acquired Oxbow (small animal supplements) for $135M in 2021peakstonegroup.com. This illustrates how even broader pet product companies are bolting on nutraceutical lines to capture the high-growth “wellness” segment.

Overall, Pure-Play Pet Brands thrive on innovation speed, marketing, and customer engagement. They often enjoy gross margins >60% (as with Swedencare’s 58.5% gross margin in Q4 2024finance.yahoo.comfinance.yahoo.com) thanks to premium pricing and efficient DTC distribution. Their competitive strengths include brand loyalty, strong e-commerce competency, and often a charismatic story (founders with a passion for pets’ health). However, competition is intensifying, and as retail shelf space fills up, differentiation (through clinical evidence or unique formulations) is becoming criticallincolninternational.comlincolninternational.com. Those that succeed in omnichannel distribution – selling via vets, Amazon, Chewy, and mass retail – are better insulated from shifting consumer buying patterns.

V.1.4 The Manufacturing Engine: CDMOs and Ingredient Suppliers

A fourth critical archetype is the B2B backbone of the industry: contract development & manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and raw ingredient suppliers that enable the above brands to exist. These players operate behind the scenes, supplying specialized ingredients or producing finished nutraceuticals on behalf of brand owners.

Ingredient Manufacturers – Companies like Aker BioMarine (Norway) exemplify this group. Aker is the world’s leading producer of krill-derived nutrients (Omega-3 rich oils, proteins) used in pet supplements and aquafeed. In 2023 Aker had $335.3M revenue (+21% YoY) and $70M EBITDAakerbiomarine.com, indicating a ~21% margin in a B2B context. It supplies major pet food and supplement companies with its branded ingredients (e.g. QRILL™ Pet for pet food and Superba™ Krill for human supplements). Aker’s key partners include premium pet food brands looking to fortify diets with marine omega-3s for coat and joint benefits. Similarly, Solabia Group (France) provides algae-derived ingredients – after acquiring Algatech, it offers astaxanthin from Haematococcus algae (used as an antioxidant in pet and feed products) and serves both nutraceutical firms and feed companies (for salmon pigmentation). These ingredient specialists often have proprietary extraction or fermentation technologies, giving them high barriers to entry. They typically scale by partnering with multiple supplement brands globally, and by continuously innovating new nutraceutical compounds (e.g. fermented soy peptides, novel prebiotics).

Premix and Vitamin Blenders – SternVitamin (Germany) and Balchem (USA) fall here. They create custom nutrient premixes and encapsulated vitamin/mineral blends used by pet food and supplement manufacturers. For example, SternVitamin might formulate a premix of vitamins, taurine, and glucosamine tailored for a client’s senior dog supplement, ensuring uniform distribution and stability. These firms are vital for smaller brands that lack in-house formulation expertise. Balchem (NYSE: BCPC), known for encapsulated choline and amino acids, has an animal nutrition division with solid margins (~20% EBITDA) and trades around 15× EBITDA as a specialized supplier. Their value-add is technical know-how in stabilization and delivery (e.g. encapsulating ingredients to survive pelleting heat or to target release in the gut). They partner with both feed mills and pet supplement companies, often under multi-year supply agreements.

Contract Manufacturers (CDMOs) – A number of firms specialize in contract manufacturing of pet supplements, offering turnkey production (from ingredient sourcing to mixing, extrusion, and packaging). Vitrition UK is one such CDMO, making private-label liquid and powder supplements for clients worldwidebcmpa.org.uk. In the U.S., Pacific Nutritional or Pegasus Labs have filled this role historically. Recently, Vetio (with facilities in US & Canada) emerged as a leading CDMO for animal nutraceutical chews and tablets – so much so that Swedencare acquired Vetio to integrate supplyswedencare.com. The role of CDMOs is growing as more brands emerge without manufacturing capacity. They offer scalability (able to ramp production for a successful product) and regulatory compliance expertise (ensuring NASC certification, GMP standards). Key partners for CDMOs include fast-growing DTC brands that prefer to outsource making the chews or powders so they can focus on marketing. Many CDMOs are B2B quiet players, but their scale can be significant – for instance, Petlabs (USA) produces millions of soft chews monthly for various brand owners. Estimates suggest top pet supplement CDMOs have revenues in the $50–100M range each, serving dozens of client brands.

Specialty Feed Additive Suppliers – Firms like Vetagro (Italy) illustrate this niche. Vetagro produces micro-encapsulated organic acids and nutrients for livestock and companion animals, enabling controlled release in the digestive tract. They partner with integrators and feed companies to incorporate these encapsulated additives for improved gut health and performance. While relatively smaller (tens of millions in revenue), such suppliers carve out high-margin niches (thanks to patented encapsulation tech). Kemin Industries (private, USA) is a larger example, with ~$1 billion in revenue across feed and food ingredients. Kemin supplies antioxidants, palatants, and functional ingredients (like Beta-Glucan for immunity) to pet food and supplement makers. It remains family-owned but is a key global player with manufacturing on multiple continents.

In summary, the CDMOs and ingredient suppliers form the foundation of the value chain. They often operate on a B2B model with fewer but larger customers (e.g. one CDMO may produce for 20 different supplement brands). Their competitive advantage is technical specialization – whether it’s extraction (marine oils, botanical extracts), formulation science, or manufacturing efficiency. Scale varies widely: some (like Aker) are publicly traded mid-cap companies, others are divisions of conglomerates (DSM Nutritional Products), and many are privately-held specialists. This archetype is increasingly important as the industry grows – strong demand for novel nutraceutical ingredients (e.g. postbiotics, insect protein) and for manufacturing capacity (especially for popular formats like soft chews) has meant these B2B players can command higher valuations recently. For instance, a contract manufacturer with unique dosage form technology or a proprietary ingredient with IP (“defensible” niche) can see interest from private equity or strategic buyers at 10–12× EBITDA, whereas more commodity ingredient blenders trade closer to 6–8× (in line with broader feed ingredient peers). In Part IV’s value chain discussion, we noted how upstream suppliers often capture modest margin, but those with proprietary products (the “IP suppliers”) can capture outsized value.

Categories: Public vs. Private within each archetype
Insight: Illustrates that Big Pharma and Feed Titans are mostly public, while many CDMOs and Pure-Plays are privately held or PE-backed—highlighting differences in disclosure, growth funding, and acquisition targets.



V.2 Valuation Trends and Drivers

Valuations in the veterinary nutraceutical sector have bifurcated into a two-speed market. Investors place a hefty premium on pet-focused nutraceutical companies – often valuing them akin to high-growth consumer or tech firms – while treating livestock-oriented firms more like stable, lower-growth specialty chemical businesses. In 2024–2025, this divergence has only sharpened. Below we examine the valuation landscape, including recent trading comparables and deal multiples for a sample of companies, and analyze the key drivers behind these valuations.

Feed & Additives (e.g. ForFarmers, Phibro): 7–10×

Ingredient Suppliers/CDMOs (e.g. Aker, Vetio): 8–12×

Insight: Shows investors’ appetite for brand-driven and IP-rich assets vs. commodity-exposed businesses.



V.2.1 The “Pet Premium” vs. “Livestock Stability” – A Two-Speed Market

Companion Animal Plays Command Premium Multiples: Companies serving the pet nutraceutical market are achieving EBITDA multiples in the mid-teens to 20×+ range, especially at the height of market cycles. This “Pet Premium” stems from several factors:

Humanization & Growth: Investors see pet wellness as a secular growth story akin to human health & beauty. Many pet supplement brands have sustained 15–20% annual growth. For example, Swedencare at its peak traded above 18× EBITDA (and ~4× revenue), reflecting not only its 20% organic growth but also the market’s exuberance for pet healthcare roll-ups. Likewise, Trupanion (pet insurance) and Freshpet (premium pet food) have in the past traded at high revenue multiples; while not nutraceuticals per se, they underscore the broader pet sector’s lofty valuations on growth potential and recurring revenue. A pure nutraceutical example: when Zesty Paws sold for $610M in 2021, the implied valuation was ~35× EBITDA and 8× salesmarketscreener.com – essentially pricing in continued rapid growth and brand value.

Compliance & Format Advantages: Certain product formats associated with high compliance have garnered premium valuations. The draft whitepaper dubbed this the “Soft Chew Multiplier”. Brands that pioneered soft chews (palatable treats delivering supplements) like Zesty Paws or Pet Honesty enjoy better customer adherence (dogs think they’re treats, so owners give them daily). High compliance drives repeat sales, boosting customer lifetime value – investors reward this with higher multiples. In essence, a company excelling in format innovation can be worth more per dollar of EBITDA than one selling pills or powders.

Subscription and DTC Models: Some pet supplement companies, especially those with strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels, are valued almost like tech firms. The presence of subscription programs – e.g., YuMOVE’s monthly joint supplement delivery – creates predictable revenue. This has led analysts to compare them to SaaS businesses. A brand with, say, 50% of sales on auto-ship subscription can see multiple expansion because of reduced churn and marketing spend. For instance, UK’s Lintbells (YuMOVE) was valued at a high revenue multiple upon PE exit, partly due to its robust subscription base driving SaaS-like metrics. Similarly, Chewy’s launch of its own supplement line “Vibeful” leverages auto-ship; if it were a standalone venture with high retention, it could attract premium valuation.

By contrast, Livestock and Feed-Focused firms trade at lower multiples, generally in the high single to low double digits EBITDA (6–12× range). This “Livestock Stability” valuation reflects their steadier, volume-driven business and somewhat commodity-influenced economics:

Lower Growth, More Cyclicality: Poultry, swine, and cattle supplement businesses tend to grow in single digits (%), tied to agricultural cycles and meat production trends rather than the surging pet wellness trend. For instance, ForFarmers – despite an excellent 2024 – is valued around 6–8× EBITDA, with enterprise value about €700M against €100M EBITDAforfarmersgroup.eu. Its core feed business has low organic growth and is subject to commodity swings, so the market assigns a conservative multiple. Similarly, Phibro Animal Health, which sells mineral supplements and medicated feed additives for livestock, trades ~8× EBITDA – reflecting stable but slow-growing demand.

Specialty vs Commodity Split: Within livestock players, those with more patented or specialty products do achieve moderately higher multiples (low teens). For example, Adisseo (feed additives/vitamins) and Novozymes (enzymes/probiotics) historically traded in the 12–15× EBITDA range, as their offerings are differentiated and higher margin. But a pure feed mill or premix blender often sees <8×. Vetoquinol, an animal health company with a mix of pharma and supplements, saw its EV/EBITDA drop to ~7× in 2024valueinvesting.io (5-year avg ~11×) due to headwinds in its U.S. businessvetoquinol.com – again indicating how the market penalizes softness in growth or overexposure to competitive segments.

Volume and Margin Characteristics: Livestock supplement firms often operate on large volumes with lower gross margins (especially feed additives mixed into bulk feed). The market views them akin to specialty chemical or ingredients companies. EV/EBITDA multiples of ~10× are common for such firms globally. Even when growth opportunities exist (e.g., rising demand for methane-reducing additives), investors balance that against regulatory complexities and farmer uptake uncertainty. The result is a relatively tempered valuation environment, albeit one that is creeping upward for innovative plays (discussed below).

Trading Comps (2024–2025 Examples): To illustrate this two-speed market, consider a spectrum of companies and their approximate valuation multiples as of late 2025:

Zoetis (ZTS) – The blue-chip pet & livestock pharma trades around 15–20× EBITDA (down from >30× a couple years ago)investing.comfinance.yahoo.com. Its premium reflects high margins and mid-single-digit growth in a defensive industry.

Swedencare (SWED-A.ST) – After a post-COVID re-rating, it trades near 14–16× EBITDA (enterprise value ~$7.5B SEK vs ~560M SEK EBITDA in 2024swedencare.comswedencare.com). This is lower than its peak >18×, but still a premium to most feed companies – justified by its ~20% gross growth (organic+M&A) and asset-light, high-margin model.

H&H Group (1112.HK) – Owner of Zesty Paws, its Pet Nutrition & Care segment grew ~29% YoYpetfoodprocessing.net, and group EV/EBITDA is ~12×. Arguably, if broken out, the pet segment might be valued higher by a buyer due to its growth and brand.

Virbac (VIRP.PA) – A mixed animal health company with some petfood and nutraceutical lines, trading ~12× EBITDA (market cap ~€2.3B, EBITDA ~€190M). It straddles pet and livestock, hence a middling multiple.

ADM (ADM) – Agro-conglomerate with animal nutrition exposure, trades around 7–8× EBITDA (stock market values its stable cash flows and large asset base similarly to a commodity processor).

ForFarmers (AMS:FFARM) – As noted, ~7× EBITDA in 2025 after profitability reboundvalueinvesting.io.

Vetoquinol (VETO.PA) – ~7–8× EBITDA in late 2024valueinvesting.io; a combination of mid-single-digit growth and recent earnings dip led to the lower end of its historical range.

Dechra Pharmaceuticals – A UK-based animal pharma (with some pet nutraceutical diets) was taken private in 2023 at 25.9× EBITDApehub.com, one of the highest deal multiples seen, showing that strategic buyers will pay up for quality companion-animal assets. (Dechra’s case had scarcity value as one of few pure-play public vet pharmas.)

Zesty Paws acquisition – ~35× EBITDA (as mentioned)marketscreener.com.

NaturVet acquisition (Swedencare deal) – ~24× EBITDAglobalpetindustry.com.

Mid-size deals: Many mid-market pet supplement acquisitions (e.g. Pet Honesty, VetriScience) have occurred in the 15–20× EBITDA range according to investment bank reports, whereas livestock additive deals (e.g. EW Nutrition acquiring Novus’s enzymes, or private equity roll-ups in feed additives) often happen around 10–12× EBITDA.

In summary, the companion segment carries a sizable valuation premium. As one report quipped, pet supplement companies are valued “like Consumer Tech/Beauty” while livestock supplement companies are valued “like Specialty Chemicals”. This two-speed valuation makes strategic sense – the former enjoy faster growth, stronger brand equity, and direct consumer spending dynamics, whereas the latter offer stability, B2B customer bases, and often commodity risk. Investors arbitrage this by, for example, acquiring undervalued livestock players at ~10×, consolidating to achieve scale, and aiming to exit at ~13–14× (a strategy some PE firms are employing).

V.2.2 Valuation Multiples by Archetype and Notable Transactions

Figure V.2 (Bar Chart: Valuation Multiples by Archetype) would illustrate this clearly, plotting average EV/EBITDA multiples for Pet Brands (~16×), Animal Health Pharma (~14×), Feed Ingredients/Specialty (~11×) and Commodity Feed (~7×). The spread between ~16× and ~7× underscores the dichotomy.



Figure V.5 – M&A Multiples: Selected Transactions (2021–2025)

Type: Column or Waterfall Chart

Examples:

Zesty Paws (~35× EBITDA)

NaturVet (~24×)

Dechra (~25.9×)

ForFarmers (~7×)

Vetoquinol (~7–8×)
Insight: Shows how pet-facing companies have been acquired at premiums compared to livestock-facing firms.



Recent M&A deals further highlight valuation drivers:

High-growth, consumer-facing brands have fetched revenue multiples unheard of in traditional feed. Zesty Paws at >4× revenue is one example; NaturVet at ~7.4× revenueglobalpetindustry.com is another. Buyers (often larger strategics or PE) were willing to pay over 20× EBITDA because they see potential to scale these brands globally and cross-sell through new channels (as Swedencare is doing by taking NaturVet internationalglobalpetindustry.com).

On the flip side, a company like ForFarmers with billions in sales but razor-thin margins would likely only fetch perhaps 0.3–0.5× revenue (since its EBITDA is just ~3–4% of sales). Indeed, its current market cap plus debt implies a value not far above its annual sales – a stark contrast to pet nutrition companies that can be worth several times their sales.

There is also a “consolidation arbitrage” at play in livestock segments: for instance, EQT’s roll-up of multiple feed additive firms. They might acquire at ~10× EBITDA and aim to exit the combined entity at 13–14× by virtue of increased scale, broader product range (earning a slight premium), and perhaps tapping public markets which reward larger, more liquid companies.

Another notable transaction: EQT’s take-private of Dechra at ~26× EBITDApehub.com, mentioned above, signaled that scarce assets in the companion animal pharma/nutrition space can attract private equity bidding wars. Similarly, Permira’s acquisition of Anivive (hypothetical example) or other deals in pet tech/wellness often price in substantial growth expectations.

In essence, deal activity over the past 2–3 years maps to a valuation continuum: at the high end, popular pet supplement brands and specialty vet health companies (often 15×–25× EBITDA in transactions), and at the lower end, feed and additive companies (6×–12×). There are of course exceptions (a uniquely positioned feed additive with patented IP and sustainability angles might break into high-teens).

One must also note public market fluctuations: 2022–2023 saw some multiple compression as interest rates rose, hitting high-growth stocks hardest. Swedencare’s share price, for example, pulled back from all-time highs, bringing its multiple from ~30× down to the mid-teens. However, by 2025 the market stabilized and started to re-rate quality assets upward again. Many expect that any company demonstrating an ability to capture recurring revenue and international growth in the pet space will swiftly return to >20× valuations.

Several contemporary factors are inflating valuations for nutraceutical companies – or at least supporting the high end of the ranges discussed – even as investors grow more discerning post-2021. Key drivers include regulatory tailwinds, sustainability pressures, and business model shifts:

Regulatory Catalysts & “Market Access” Easing: A major development is the anticipated passage of the Innovative FEED Act in the U.S., which has bipartisan support in Congresslangworthy.house.gov. This law aims to modernize FDA rules by shifting certain animal feed ingredients (like novel enzymes, probiotics, methane inhibitors) out of the “drug” category and into a streamlined feed approval processcongress.govcongress.gov. If enacted in 2024/25, it would significantly fast-track the commercialization of new nutraceutical additives, especially those with environmental or novel mode-of-action benefits. Companies positioned with products awaiting approval (e.g. seaweed-based methane reducers by CH4 Globalch4global.com, or next-gen probiotics) could see their addressable market accelerate – driving investor enthusiasm and higher valuations on future earnings. Similarly, in the EU, regulators and EFSA have shown willingness to fast-track feed additives tied to sustainability, such as granting quicker authorization for methane-reducing feed products and immunomodulatory additives. A timeline of milestones – Figure V.3 could plot events like EFSA’s special guidance in Dec 2024 to expedite efficacy assessment of feed additivesefsa.europa.euefsa.europa.eu, or the EU’s 2022 approval of Bovaer, and the U.S. FDA’s CVM evolving stance on pet supplement claims. These regulatory “green lights” reduce uncertainty and effectively inflate asset prices by bringing future cashflows closer. Companies that once labored under lengthy approval horizons now are more attractive as time-to-market shortens.

Insight: Contextualizes how regulatory clarity boosts M&A appetite and valuation.



Sustainability Mandates (Scope 3 Emissions): The pressure on agriculture and pet food to reduce carbon footprint has become a valuation driver. Livestock integrators and food companies have Scope 3 emission targets that depend on feed additives to cut methane, nitrogen excretion, etc. This has given a “green premium” to nutraceutical firms with climate solutions. For example, a feed additive company with a patented methane inhibitor or a proven probiotic reducing enteric emissions can command heightened interest from both strategic acquirers and ESG-focused investors. They are often valued more like “Climate Tech” startups than traditional feed businesses. We see evidence: DSM paid a premium for start-ups in this space (e.g. acquiring Erber Group’s Biomin which had gut health and mycotoxin tech) and in valuations like Mootral (garlic-based methane reducer) attracting venture-type multiples. Pet supplement firms are affected too: eco-friendly positioning (e.g. using upcycled ingredients, carbon-neutral supply chains) can boost brand equity. Large CPGs looking to burnish their pet portfolios’ sustainability may pay extra for a brand known for green sourcing or recyclable packaging. In sum, sustainability is now a bona fide valuation driver – it transforms otherwise utilitarian additives into hot assets by aligning with global climate commitments.

“Science > Hype”: Clinical Proof as a Differentiator – In 2024, investors have become more selective, favoring companies with real clinical evidence for their products over those riding general wellness trends. This shift is partly due to impending regulatory scrutiny on supplement claims (the FDA and FTC have signaled closer watch on pet supplement marketing). Brands like Nutramax (with peer-reviewed studies for Cosequin) or YuMOVE (backed by clinical trials showing improved mobility in dogs) are considered lower-risk and more defensible, supporting higher valuation multiples. They are more likely to withstand a scenario where regulatory changes require proof of efficacy. Conversely, a plethora of “white-label” or copycat supplement brands that sprang up online are seeing multiple compression – many are finding it hard to raise capital or attract buyers, and if they do sell, it may be closer to 1× revenue (or under 10× EBITDA) unless they have something unique. Thus, clinical proof has become a key value driver: it turns a supplement company into a quasi-pharma profile, with potential to become an “evidence-based” category leader that vets and regulators trust. Buyers are willing to pay up for that credibility, as it can translate to sustained pricing power and market share.

Omnichannel Presence & Resilience: A few years ago, direct-to-consumer was all the rage – companies with 100% online sales were valued richly for cutting out middlemen. But by 2024, rising digital advertising costs and iOS privacy changes have made pure DTC less profitable. Customer acquisition cost (CAC) spiked, squeezing DTC brands’ margins. Accordingly, multiples for pure-play e-commerce pet brands have compressed. The highest valuations now go to omnichannel brands – those that have successful DTC and are winning in marketplaces (Amazon/Chewy) and brick-and-mortar retail. Investors view a diversified channel mix as a sign of broad consumer acceptance and lower risk. For example, a supplement brand that started online but now has placements in Petco, Tractor Supply, and vet clinics can fetch a higher multiple than one stuck primarily on its own website. Recent IPOs and M&A in the pet space show this trend: companies tout their omnichannel strategy to justify valuations. Chewy’s data indicates that online growth is still strong (pet e-commerce up 25% YoY in 2024)emplicit.coemplicit.co, but the brands that succeed on Chewy are often those also visible elsewhere. The ability to scale in mass retail (where ~50% of pet supplements are still sold) and to navigate international markets is a valuation booster. Private equity buyers perform channel checks – a brand heavy on Amazon but not in vet clinics may be valued at, say, 10× EBITDA, whereas one with a unique vet channel presence plus solid Amazon sales might get 15×, because the latter suggests both consumer and professional endorsement.

Finally, we note that the current market also penalizes certain factors – effectively compressing multiples if present (as depicted in Figure V.4: Valuation Bridge). Factors that tend to compress EBITDA multiples include: reliance on a single channel (e.g. 80% of sales via Amazon – a key person risk with Amazon algorithms), heavy concentration in commodity ingredients (no IP, easily copied), or looming regulatory headwinds (for instance, a company selling CBD pet supplements – given regulatory ambiguity, it likely trades at a discount). On the other hand, expanders of multiples include: proprietary IP (patented molecules or exclusive ingredient sourcing), recurring revenue models, verified “green” claims, and strong branding/moat in a category.

To illustrate, a company like Bovaer (DSM) which has patented tech to reduce cow methane not only benefits from the green premium but also from IP exclusivity – thus if it were standalone it could likely command a >15× multiple even as a livestock-focused business (combining both livestock stability and a tech-like premium). Contrast that with a generic garlic powder supplement for horses sold mostly on Amazon – even if it has decent revenue, it might only be worth 1× sales due to lack of differentiation and high platform fees (single-channel risk).

In conclusion, valuations in 2024–2025 are being shaped by a mix of market narratives and fundamentals. The “pets vs. production” valuation gap remains, but within each segment the winners will be those who align with the big drivers: regulatory tailwinds (making approval and expansion easier), sustainability (offering solutions to global challenges), and proof & presence (backed by science and present wherever customers shop). Companies checking those boxes are seeing enthusiastic investor appetite, often translating to EBITDA multiples at the upper end of historical ranges or even new highs, despite a more cautious economic backdrop than a few years ago. The coming years will likely continue this two-speed trend, unless a major convergence happens (for instance, if livestock nutraceuticals start growing as fast as pet supplements, or if pet market growth cools). For now, though, the map of valuations is clearly bifurcated – and understanding the drivers above is key to navigating investment or acquisition decisions in this industry.
