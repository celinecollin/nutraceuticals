Antibiotic Use by Species – Sources and References

# European Union / ESVAC (EMA)

- ESVAC (EMA). Sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents in 31 European countries (various annual reports).

- Key findings: −43% antimicrobial sales (2011–2020) in consistently reporting countries; additional −31% reduction 2018–2022.

- Species-level insights reflect highest reductions in pigs and poultry.

# France (ANSES)

- ANSES – Résapath & surveillance nationale de l’exposition aux antibiotiques (2020).

- Reductions 2011–2020: Poultry −64.4%, Swine −55.5%, Cattle −22.5%, Rabbits −39.9%, Cats/Dogs −11.8%.

- Represents the most granular species-level data in EU.

# United States (FDA)

- FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). Annual Summary Reports on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food-Producing Animals (2015–2023).

- Key trend: −35% reduction in medically important antibiotics (2015–2022).

- Species allocation (2022 MI antibiotics): Swine 43%, Cattle 41%, Turkeys 12%, Chickens 2%.

# Global / WOAH (ex-OIE)

- WOAH ANIMUSE Global Database – Annual Reports (2015–2021).

- Provides mg/kg biomass antimicrobial usage by global region.

- Confirms reductions in many regions and highlights high variability in aquaculture.

# Note on Methodology

Because global species-stratified antibiotic use data is incomplete, reductions since 2015 are inferred from the best-aligned datasets: EU trends (ESVAC), France species exposure (ANSES), US MI sales (FDA), and WOAH regional mg/kg data. EU and France provide the clearest species-specific historical declines; the US provides strong MI category data but not always species-level history.
