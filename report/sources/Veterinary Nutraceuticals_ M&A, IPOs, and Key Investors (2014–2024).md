# Veterinary Nutraceuticals: M&A, IPOs, and Key Investors (2014–2024)

## Notable Mergers, Acquisitions, and IPOs (2014–2024)

Over the past decade, the veterinary nutraceuticals sector – spanning pet supplements, livestock feed additives, and aquaculture nutrition – has seen significant consolidation and investment. Below is a list of notable M&A transactions and IPOs in this space, including acquirer/target, date, deal size (if disclosed), transaction type, and segment focus:

### Companion Animal (Pet) Supplements & Nutrition

Swedencare – NaturVet (2022): In February 2022, Swedencare AB (Sweden) acquired NaturVet (USA), one of the largest U.S. pet supplement brands, for $447.5 million[1]. This was a 100% acquisition (M&A), giving Swedencare a strong foothold in premium pet supplements (NaturVet produces supplements for pet health across ~20 categories). Segment focus: companion animal supplements.

Health & Happiness (H&H) Group – Zesty Paws (2021): H&H Group (Hong Kong) agreed in August 2021 to acquire Zesty Paws (USA), a fast-growing e-commerce pet supplement leader, for $610 million[2]. The deal (closed October 2021) was a full acquisition (M&A) and marked H&H’s second pet nutrition deal (after buying Solid Gold in 2020 for $163M)[3]. Segment: companion animal supplements (functional soft chews for dogs and cats).

Swedencare – Vetio (2021): In July 2021, Swedencare announced the acquisition of Vetio (USA/Canada), a contract manufacturer specializing in veterinary nutraceutical dermatology and liquid supplement products, for $181.5 million[4]. Type: M&A (platform acquisition to enhance North American production). Segment: companion animal supplement manufacturing.

BC Partners – PetLab Co. (2025): BC Partners (a global PE firm) agreed in Feb 2025 to acquire a majority stake in PetLab Co. (UK/US), a rapidly growing D2C pet supplement brand[5]. Terms were not disclosed. This majority investment/buyout builds on BC Partners’ pet sector track record (previous investments in Chewy, PetSmart, etc.)[6]. Segment: companion animal supplements (probiotic chews, dental powders, etc., for pet wellness).

Vetnique Labs (Gryphon Investors) – Lintbells (YuMOVE) (2024): Vetnique Labs (USA), backed by Gryphon Investors (PE), acquired Lintbells (UK) – maker of YuMOVE joint-care pet supplements – from Inflexion PE in 2024[7]. Financial terms undisclosed. This strategic acquisition (PE-sponsored M&A) creates a transatlantic pet health platform, uniting Vetnique’s U.S. supplement portfolio (e.g. Glandex) with YuMOVE’s UK leadership in joint, digestive, and calming supplements[8][9]. Segment: companion animal supplements.

Carlyle Group – Manna Pro (Compana) (2020): Global PE firm Carlyle acquired a majority stake in Manna Pro Products (USA) in November 2020 (from Morgan Stanley Capital Partners)[10][11]. Deal size not public. Manna Pro (now rebranded Compana Pet Brands) is a leading provider of pet health & nutrition products, including pet supplements, treats, and feed for hobby animals. Type: PE buyout. Segment: companion animal nutrition/supplements (Carlyle noted Manna Pro’s growth via acquisitions like Fruitables treats and Doggie Dailies supplements)[11].

NXMH – Whitebridge Pet Brands (2021): In August 2021, NXMH (Belgium-based investment firm) acquired Whitebridge Pet Brands (USA)[12]. Whitebridge is known for natural pet foods, treats, and supplements (brands like Tiki Pets, Buddy Biscuits, and Grizzly Pet Products for omega-3 supplements). M&A transaction, price undisclosed. Segment: companion animal nutrition & supplements (part of a trend of European investors entering North America).

ADM – P4 Companies (PetDine et al.) (2021): In late 2021, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) announced it would acquire ~75% of P4 Companies (USA), owner of PetDine, Pedigree Ovens, etc., which are contract manufacturers of pet treats and supplements, in a deal valuing P4 at $600 million[13]. This majority acquisition gave ADM a foothold in the fast-growing pet supplement co-manufacturing segment. Segment: companion animal supplements (manufacturing/private label).

H&H Group – Solid Gold (2020): H&H (which later bought Zesty Paws) acquired Solid Gold Pet (USA) in November 2020 for $163 million[3]. Solid Gold is a premium pet food and supplement brand (focused on holistic nutrition). Type: M&A. Segment: pet nutrition (natural pet food with supplement-like benefits).

PetIQ (2017 IPO): PetIQ Inc. (USA), a pet health products company (pet OTC meds, vitamins and wellness products), went public in July 2017 on NASDAQ. It raised approximately $85 million in its IPO (5.7 million shares at $14–16 range) valuing the company around $300 million[14]. Segment: companion animal health & wellness (PetIQ distributes vet-recommended pet meds and supplements). (Type: IPO.)

Phibro Animal Health (2014 IPO): Phibro (USA), a manufacturer of animal health and nutritional products (including medicated feed additives and supplements), completed an IPO in April 2014. The offering was priced at $15/share (below the $16–18 range) and raised ~$176.5 million (11.765 million shares)[15]. Phibro, backed by 3i Group, listed on NASDAQ under “PAHC”, highlighting investor appetite for livestock nutraceutical and health companies[16][17]. Segment: livestock health & nutrition. (Type: IPO.)

(Note: Other pet-sector IPOs like Chewy (2019, pet e-commerce) and BarkBox (via SPAC in 2021) signaled strong capital markets interest in pet care, though these were broader pet product companies. The deals listed above focus on nutraceutical and supplement players.)

### Livestock Feed Additives & Animal Nutrition

Cargill – Diamond V (2017): Cargill (USA) agreed in October 2017 to acquire Diamond V (USA), an Iowa-based maker of natural microbial feed additives (yeast-based nutraceuticals for livestock), to expand its animal nutrition and health business[18]. Terms were not disclosed. The deal closed in 2018, including Diamond V’s human health arm as well[18][19]. Type: M&A. Segment focus: livestock feed additives (probiotics/yeast) for digestive and immune health.

Cargill – Delacon (2017 & 2022): Cargill made a strategic equity investment in Delacon (Austria) in July 2017[20], and later in June 2022 signed an agreement to fully acquire Delacon[21]. Delacon is the globally leading expert in phytogenic feed additives (plant-based essential oil and herbal supplements for animal diets). These moves (first a minority stake, then full acquisition) aimed to make Cargill a leader in natural, plant-based feed solutions. Segment: livestock & poultry phytogenics.

DSM – Biomin (Erber Group) (2020): Royal DSM (Netherlands) announced in June 2020 the acquisition of Erber Group’s Biomin and Romer Labs units for an enterprise value of €980 million[22]. Biomin (Austria) is a specialty animal nutrition company known for mycotoxin binders, probiotics, and other feed additives, while Romer Labs focuses on food/feed safety diagnostics[23]. This M&A strengthened DSM’s position in livestock nutraceuticals and gut health solutions. (Segment: livestock feed additives & gut health).

ADM – Probiotics International (Protexin) (2018): ADM (USA) expanded into veterinary and human probiotics by acquiring UK-based Probiotics International Ltd (PIL, brand Protexin) in June 2018 for £185 million (≈$243.5M)[24]. PIL/Protexin produces probiotic supplements for animal health and human wellness, including products for aquaculture, equine, livestock, and pets[25]. This was a full acquisition (M&A), bolstering ADM’s microbiome and nutraceutical portfolio. Segment: probiotic nutraceuticals for multiple animal species.

Alltech – Ridley Inc. (2015): Alltech (USA, a private animal nutrition company) acquired Ridley Inc. (Canada) in 2015 for about $521 million (noted as a major deal in feed industry consolidation)[26]. Ridley produces animal feed, supplements, and premixes for livestock and equine. This M&A deal expanded Alltech’s global feed supplement footprint (segment: livestock & equine nutrition). (Source: Alltech press, 2015.)

Archer Daniels Midland – Neovia (2019): ADM acquired Neovia (France) in early 2019 for €1.535 billion (approx. $1.8B) in enterprise value. Neovia was a global animal nutrition group (with premixes, feed additives, and pet food). This large acquisition signaled ADM’s strategy to become a world leader in animal nutrition. Segment: livestock and pet nutrition (including premix and specialty feed additives). (Source: ADM press release, 2019.)

(The livestock feed additive segment has also seen notable joint ventures and strategic investments, e.g. Evonik and DSM’s Veramaris (2017) for omega-3 algae in aquafeed, and various agritech startups in probiotics and enzymes receiving industry backing. Overall, major agribusinesses (ADM, Cargill, DSM, etc.) have actively acquired feed additive and specialty nutrition firms to diversify into higher-margin animal wellness products[24][27].)

### Aquaculture Nutrition & Health

Benchmark Holdings – INVE Aquaculture (2015): In December 2015, Benchmark Holdings (UK) acquired INVE Aquaculture (Belgium) for $342 million (approx. €312M)[28]. INVE is a leading manufacturer of specialized aquaculture nutrition and health products – including hatchery feeds, probiotics, and immune stimulants for shrimp and fish. This M&A gave Benchmark (an aquaculture health company) a major presence in aquaculture nutraceuticals and feed, expanding its product range in the aquafeed additives segment[28].

Zoetis – Pharmaq (2015): Zoetis (USA), while primarily known for veterinary pharmaceuticals, acquired Pharmaq (Norway) in 2015 for ~$765 million. Pharmaq is a leader in vaccines and health products for farmed fish. (Though more of a pharma/biologics deal, it underscored the growing importance of aquaculture health. Segment: aquaculture vaccines & health.)

Cargill – EWOS (2015): Cargill entered aquafeeds by acquiring EWOS (Norway) in 2015 for $1.5 billion. EWOS is a major salmon feed producer. (Again, a feed deal rather than nutraceutical per se, but it paved the way for functional feeds with nutraceutical additives in Cargill’s portfolio.)

(Overall, aquaculture feed and nutraceutical deals, such as Benchmark-INVE, reflect the increasing focus on fish/shrimp health and nutrition. These deals have enabled delivery of probiotics, immune boosters, and functional diets in aquaculture – a segment that has seen high growth in APAC and Europe.)

## Active Venture Capital (VC) and Private Equity (PE) Investors in Veterinary Nutraceuticals

Numerous investors have recognized the growth potential in pet wellness and animal nutrition. Below is a list of active VC and PE firms investing in veterinary nutraceuticals, along with their notable portfolio companies, typical investment stage, and geographic focus:

### Venture Capital Firms (Early-Stage Focus)

Mars Petcare / Digitalis – Companion Fund: Mars Petcare (global pet products leader) and Digitalis Ventures jointly run the Companion Fund, a venture fund dedicated to pet care startups. Notable investments include AnimalBiome (pet microbiome supplements) and Smalls (direct-to-consumer pet nutrition), among others. For example, Companion Fund participated in Smalls’ $9M Series A for healthy cat food[29] and in AnimalBiome’s seed round[30]. Stage: Early-stage (Seed to Series B). Geography: U.S. and Europe (global scope for innovative pet health ventures).

Michelson Found Animals Foundation (Leap Venture Studio): A Los Angeles-based animal welfare foundation with a venture arm, it co-runs the Leap Venture Studio accelerator for pet care startups. It has backed companies like Wild Earth (alternative protein pet treats) and Native Pet (clean-label pet supplements; Native Pet raised $11M Series B in 2022 led by CAVU)[31]. Stage: Seed/Early-stage. Geography: North America (with some global participants).

CAVU Consumer Partners: A U.S. consumer-focused VC/growth fund that has actively moved into pet wellness. CAVU led a recent $11M funding for Native Pet (pet supplements)[31] and has invested in other health/nutrition brands. Stage: Growth-stage VC (Series B/C). Geography: Primarily North America.

S2G Ventures (Seed 2 Growth): A food and agri-tech VC fund in the U.S. that invests in sustainable protein and animal health. Portfolio includes Because Animals (cultured pet nutrition) and Beta Hatch (insect protein for feed). It also backed Wild Earth (vegan pet treats). Stage: Early to growth-stage. Geography: USA focus with global ag-tech scope.

Seventure Partners (Health for Life Capital): A European VC (France) specializing in microbiome and nutrition. It has invested in Ynsect (insect protein for animal feed) and Probion (probiotic tech), and was an early investor in Probiotics International (Protexin) before its acquisition. It also funded startups like Vetbiochem (animal gut health). Stage: Early/Growth-stage. Geography: Europe (with interest in cross-border health/nutrition deals).

Anterra Capital: A Netherlands-based VC focusing on agri-food and animal health technology. Portfolio includes Ecto (Spain, insect feed ingredients) and Nutrition Technologies (Asia, insect protein), as well as animal vaccine and diagnostics startups. While not purely nutraceutical, Anterra’s focus on animal health often overlaps with nutritional innovations. Stage: Series A/B. Geography: Europe and North America (global ag-tech reach).

Dane Creek Capital: A Canadian venture/PE hybrid (“merchant bank”) focused on the pet industry. It has built a portfolio of raw pet food and supplement companies in Canada – e.g. Bold by Nature (raw food) and supplements like NaturVet Canada (through distribution partnerships). Dane Creek also acquires pet retail distributors to integrate the supply chain[32]. Stage: Early-stage and growth (often majority investments in small companies). Geography: Canada (with some expansion into U.S. pet markets).

LeapFrog Investments (and other impact VCs) – Some impact-focused VCs have shown interest in animal health in emerging markets. E.g., LeapFrog (more known for fintech/health) invested in CareVet in India (veterinary care including preventative products). While not mainstream in nutraceutical deals, this highlights regional VC interest in veterinary wellness in Asia. Stage: Growth. Geography: Asia/Emerging Markets.

(VC interest in pet nutraceuticals is a relatively recent trend, accelerating after 2018 as humanization of pets and demand for natural remedies grew. These investors often emphasize science-driven products (e.g. probiotics, CBD supplements, alternative proteins) and many are generalist consumer/health funds branching into pet wellness.)

### Private Equity Firms (Growth & Buyout Focus)

The Carlyle Group: A global PE firm with large-cap funds. Portfolio: Carlyle owns Compana Pet Brands (formerly Manna Pro), acquired in 2020[10], which itself owns dozens of pet supplement and treat brands (e.g. Vet’s Best, Nutri-Vet, Fruitables). Carlyle previously held Manna Pro in 2015 and reacquired it, indicating sustained interest in pet health. Stage: Buyouts of established companies. Geography: North America and global (Compana has international sales).

BC Partners: A leading PE firm (Europe/US) active in pet care. Portfolio: Notably invested in PetSmart/Chewy (the largest pet retailer/e-tailer) and in Antelliq (livestock health RFID, sold to Merck), and recently took a majority stake in PetLab Co. (premium pet supplement brand)[6][5]. BC Partners also owns VetPartners (UK veterinary clinics)[6]. Stage: Large buyouts and late-stage growth investments. Geography: Europe & North America (transatlantic focus).

KKR & Co.: A global investment firm with several pet sector deals. Portfolio: In 2021, KKR acquired Natural Pet Food Group (NZ, premium pet nutrition)[33], expanding into APAC’s pet market. Historically, KKR had a stake in Pets at Home (UK) and continues seeking pet/animal health platforms. Stage: Big-ticket buyouts or significant minority stakes. Geography: Global (recent focus on Asia-Pacific pet companies and North American platforms).

Inflexion Private Equity: UK-based mid-market PE. Portfolio: Invested in Lintbells (YuMOVE), the UK’s #1 pet supplement company, in 2017 to fuel its growth[34]. Inflexion exited in 2024 with a 5.5x return when YuMOVE was sold to Vetnique/Gryphon[35]. Stage: Growth capital and mid-market buyout. Geography: UK/Europe (with international expansion support).

Gryphon Investors: US mid-market PE firm. Portfolio: Formed a pet health platform with Vetnique Labs (invested in 2022) and subsequently acquired Lintbells (YuMOVE) in 2024[7]. Gryphon also has investments in pet services (e.g., dog daycare chain) and previously in veterinary diagnostics. Stage: Upper mid-market buyouts and roll-ups. Geography: North America (now expanding to UK via YuMOVE deal).

Kinderhook Industries: US-based PE focused on specialty manufacturing. Portfolio: Created Primal Pet Group by acquiring raw pet food and treat companies (Primal Pet Foods, Prairie Dog, Himalayan Corp, etc.)[36]. While more treat-focused, these brands often have nutraceutical positioning (e.g. yak chews with nutrients). Stage: Middle-market buy-and-build. Geography: North America.

Clearlake Capital: A large US PE firm. Portfolio: In Nov 2020, Clearlake acquired WellPet LLC (owns Wellness, Whimzees, Old Mother Hubbard brands)[37][38]. Wellness’s portfolio includes nutritional pet foods and supplements (e.g. dental chews with functional ingredients). Clearlake’s strategy is to grow pet wellness brands globally. Stage: Large buyouts. Geography: Global (Clearlake’s WellPet is international).

TA Associates: Global growth private equity. Portfolio: Acquired Mid America Pet Food (Victor brand) in 2020[39], and has invested in veterinary and human supplement firms historically. TA focuses on profitable pet food/supplement companies in the U.S. Stage: Late-stage growth or buyout. Geography: North America, Europe.

L Catterton: The world’s largest consumer-focused PE fund (formed by LVMH and Catterton). Portfolio: Invested in JustFoodForDogs (fresh pet nutrition, US) and made a strategic investment in Petlove (Brazil’s leading pet e-commerce with wellness products)[40]. L Catterton also previously backed IandLoveandYou (natural pet food). Stage: Growth equity and buyouts. Geography: Global (with pet deals in North America, Latin America, and Europe).

General Atlantic & Encore Capital: These growth equity firms partnered to invest $65 million in Open Farm (Canada), a premium sustainable pet food company, in 2020[41]. Open Farm’s range includes supplements (e.g. bone broth, dehydrated mix-ins). GA’s first pet investment signals growth-stage interest in pet nutrition. Stage: Growth equity. Geography: North America (GA is global, Encore is US-focused consumer PE).

NXMH (NXC Group): A Belgian investment arm of a South Korean tech billionaire, active in pet brands. Portfolio: Bought Whitebridge Pet Brands (USA) in 2021[12], and earlier acquired Tomlinson’s Feed (US retailer). NXMH tends to provide patient capital to consumer brands. Stage: Buyout. Geography: Europe-based capital investing in North America and Europe.

Vestar Capital Partners: US middle-market PE. Portfolio: In July 2021, Vestar made a majority investment in PetHonesty (Austin-based pet supplement company known for soft chews) to accelerate its growth[42]. Vestar has also invested in IKON Health (veterinary compounding and supplements) and Better Life Pet Foods. Stage: Mid-market buyouts/growth. Geography: North America.

Maxim Partners: A PE firm focused on wellness/education. Portfolio: Grew Zesty Paws from a $3M startup in 2018 into a leading pet supplement brand (over $100M revenue) before selling it for $610M in 2021[2][43]. Maxim’s success with Zesty Paws highlights PE involvement even at relatively early growth phases (it seeks wellness brands leveraging e-commerce). Stage: Lower-mid market growth equity. Geography: USA.

(In addition to dedicated investors, many strategic corporate investors have venture arms active in this space: e.g., Purina Accelerator Lab (Nestlé Purina’s pet care investments), Hills/Colgate Palmolive venture (pet nutrition start-ups), Zoetis Ventures (focused on animal health innovation), etc. These corporates often co-invest alongside VCs in promising nutraceutical technologies. Regionally, North America has the highest concentration of pet health investors, followed by Europe (UK, France, Germany) where pet supplement growth is strong, and increasingly Asia-Pacific where demand for pet wellness is rising.)

## Regional Trends

North America (USA & Canada): The U.S. is the hub of pet nutraceutical deals, with numerous startups and large transactions (e.g. $610M Zesty Paws sale[2]). Private equity activity is high, consolidating supplement brands and contract manufacturers. Venture funding flows to innovative pet wellness companies (probiotics, CBD, alternative proteins). Canada’s pet market is smaller but growing; domestic investors like Dane Creek fuel niche raw and supplement brands[32].

Europe (EU & UK): Europe has seen significant deals in both pet and livestock sectors. The UK’s Lintbells (YuMOVE) became a top supplement brand and drew PE investment and cross-border M&A[7]. Continental Europe’s big nutrition companies (DSM, ADM via its European acquisitions) have acquired feed additive firms to expand their portfolios[24]. European VCs (Seventure, Anterra) support animal nutrition innovation (e.g. insect protein, microbiome startups). The EU pet supplement market is expanding, with local players (Germany’s Anibio, France’s Greenvet) attracting interest for future deals.

Asia-Pacific (APAC): Pet ownership is rising in APAC, leading to growth in nutraceuticals. Notable trends include Japanese and Chinese firms investing in pet wellness (e.g., H&H Group from Hong Kong making global acquisitions like Zesty Paws[44]). In aquaculture-centric APAC, feed additive innovations (probiotics, enzymes) gain investment – for instance, Thai Union and CP Group have venture arms looking at shrimp/fish nutrition startups. Australia/NZ have produced pet health companies (e.g. Natural Pet Food Group, acquired by KKR[33]). While fewer purely local VC funds target this sector, global investors (KKR, L Catterton, etc.) are bringing capital into APAC pet nutrition companies.

Latin America: Brazil’s pet market (No. 3 globally) is drawing PE interest – e.g., L Catterton invested in Brazil’s Petlove (online retailer carrying supplements)[40], and Grupo Nutresa (Colombia) acquired a Costa Rican pet food firm with aquaculture feed business[45]. These deals suggest growing regional markets for pet and feed nutraceuticals, often as part of broader pet food investments.

In summary, the veterinary nutraceuticals space (2014–2024) has experienced robust M&A activity – from large agribusinesses acquiring feed supplement companies to pet-focused firms consolidating the supplements market. A few companies even tapped public markets (PetIQ, Phibro) to fuel growth[14][15]. On the financing side, a mix of specialized venture funds and big private equity players are actively investing in this sector, backing the development and expansion of innovative products for pet wellness, livestock nutrition, and aquaculture health. This convergence of strategic and financial investment underscores the global trend of “nutrition as medicine” in animal care, blurring the line between feed and pharma for better animal health outcomes[27][16].
