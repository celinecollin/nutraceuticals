# medications given and nutraceuticals.docx

1. Pets (dogs, cats, horses)

1.1 Dogs and cats

Most commonly used drug classes

We don’t have a single “top 10” list by volume, but the WSAVA essential medicines list for dogs and cats and OIE/WOAH antimicrobial listings give a good picture of what is most frequently used in general practice:

NSAIDs for pain and osteoarthritis

Carprofen, meloxicam, deracoxib, firocoxib, robenacoxib are the main veterinary NSAIDs.

Antibiotics for bacterial infections

WSAVA and WOAH list commonly authorised antibacterials:
• aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ± clavulanate)
• first/second generation cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefpodoxime, cefovecin)
• lincosamides (clindamycin)
• fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, pradofloxacin)
• nitroimidazoles (metronidazole, ornidazole, tinidazole) for GI infections.

Corticosteroids

Prednisolone is listed as the core oral corticosteroid for dogs and cats for many inflammatory and immune mediated diseases.

Key side effects

NSAIDs

Systematic review of NSAID adverse effects in dogs: most common AEs were vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia; GI ulceration, renal and hepatic injury also occur.

MSD Vet Manual and FDA CVM highlight GI signs (vomiting, diarrhea, reduced appetite) as most frequent, with rare but serious gastric ulcer/perforation and kidney or liver damage.

Antibiotics

Short term: GI upset from microbiome disruption (diarrhea, anorexia). Nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) are used for GI infections but are neurotoxic at high doses or long use.

Systemic risk: selection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that can spread between pets, humans and environment; WHO and EMA stress this in their classifications and guidance.

Corticosteroids

Long term prednisolone use is associated with polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia, weight gain, muscle wasting, thin skin, impaired wound healing, increased infection risk and iatrogenic Cushing’s. WSAVA and other guidelines list these as expected adverse effects.

How nutraceuticals can reduce reliance – evidence

a) Osteoarthritis – NSAID sparing

A 2022 systematic review and meta analysis of enriched therapeutic diets and nutraceuticals in canine/feline OA (Barbeau-Grégoire et al.) found:
• omega-3 enriched diets and GLM based products had clinically relevant analgesic effects
• collagen based nutraceuticals had weak evidence
• chondroitin–glucosamine combinations showed no meaningful analgesic effect and should not be recommended for pain management.

Reviews of OA management conclude that therapeutic diets + selected nutraceuticals can modestly reduce pain scores and improve mobility, and are valuable adjuncts in multimodal OA management.

Clinical implication:

In mild OA, vets may start with weight loss + joint diet + omega-3 / GLM nutraceuticals, reserving NSAIDs for flares.

In chronic OA, nutraceuticals can allow lower NSAID dose or fewer continuous days, reducing cumulative exposure, especially in older or CKD-risk animals. This is “NSAID sparing”, not NSAID replacement.

b) Acute diarrhea – metronidazole sparing

A double-blind RCT in 60 dogs with acute diarrhea compared a multi-strain probiotic, metronidazole and placebo. Mean time to acceptable feces: 3.5 ± 2.2 days (probiotic), 4.6 ± 2.4 (metronidazole), 4.8 ± 2.9 (placebo); no statistically significant difference.

A 2022 evidence review concluded that metronidazole may shorten diarrhea compared to placebo in some studies, but probiotics and synbiotics can produce similar or slightly better clinical recovery with fewer safety concerns, and guidelines increasingly recommend restricting antibiotics and using probiotics in uncomplicated acute diarrhea.

Clinical implication:

For uncomplicated acute diarrhea in otherwise healthy dogs, many clinicians now prefer a probiotic/synbiotic and diet modification, reserving metronidazole for more severe, persistent or confirmed infections. The nutraceutical thus replaces an empiric antibiotic course in many mild cases.

c) Behaviour – psychotropic sparing (limited)

Studies on L-theanine and α-casozepine show modest reductions in noise phobia and stress scores vs placebo, but evidence is small and heterogeneous. Review papers conclude these nutraceuticals may help in mild anxiety as adjuncts, but cannot replace psychotropics and behaviour therapy in severe cases.

So for pets, nutraceuticals → mainly adjuncts or partial sparers for NSAIDs and antibiotics, rather than outright replacements.



1.2 Horses

Most used medications

Reviews of equine NSAID use show that phenylbutazone is the most commonly prescribed NSAID for orthopaedic pain, followed by flunixin meglumine; firocoxib is also widely used.

Side effects

Phenylbutazone and flunixin are associated with GI ulceration, right dorsal colitis, nephrotoxicity and, at high doses, protein losing enteropathy; phenylbutazone is often cited as the “most toxic” NSAID in horses with respect to GI ulcers.

Nutraceuticals as NSAID sparers

Common equine nutraceuticals: joint supplements (GLM, hyaluronic acid, collagen, MSM), gastric supplements (buffers, pectins, lecithin), yeast and oil-based products.

Reviews report variable, modest benefits on lameness scores and performance; evidence is weaker than in dogs, but there is some support for improved comfort and reduced need for continuous high-dose NSAIDs in chronic cases.

Again, main role is to reduce dose/duration of NSAIDs in chronic management rather than replace them in acute, severe pain.



2. Breeding / production species

Here the main “most given” drugs are antimicrobials (antibiotics and anticoccidials); nutraceuticals/functional feed additives are actively used as alternatives.

2.1 Poultry (broilers, layers)

Most used medication classes

EMA/EFSA and other reports list tetracyclines and macrolides among the most commonly used antibiotic classes in poultry, along with penicillins and sulfonamides, historically often used in feed or water.

In addition, poultry receive anticoccidials (ionophores such as monensin, salinomycin; chemicals like diclazuril, toltrazuril) almost universally to control coccidiosis.

Side effects / systemic risks

Therapeutic index of ionophores is narrow; overdoses cause cardiotoxicity and muscle damage; accidental exposure in horses can be fatal.

Long term use of antibiotics in feed selects for resistant E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter and others that can spread to humans via food and environment; FAO/WHO and WHO’s medically important antimicrobials list highlight this as a major AMR risk.

Nutraceuticals replacing or reducing antibiotics and coccidiostats

Recent reviews show probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, organic acids and phytogenic feed additives (plant extracts/essential oils) can maintain growth, improve gut health and reduce pathogen load, acting as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs).

A global meta analysis of non antibiotic feed additives across nine livestock species confirms positive effects on growth performance, immunity and gut health, especially in monogastrics such as poultry and pigs.

Reviews on phytogenic feed additives for poultry specifically highlight their role as natural antibiotic alternatives, improving performance and gut health while reducing reliance on AGPs.

DSM-firmenich and other industry sources summarise data where phytogenic programs reduced coccidiosis risk and allowed lower or no use of conventional coccidiostats, though many of these are field data rather than peer reviewed RCTs.

So for poultry, the best supported nutraceutical roles are:
• replacing antibiotic growth promoters in routine feed,
• reducing reliance on conventional anticoccidials,
while maintaining acceptable performance and health.

2.2 Pigs

Most used medication classes

EMA and global trend analyses show that tetracyclines and macrolides are often the most commonly used antibiotic classes in pig production, followed by penicillins and sulfonamides.

Historically, high doses of zinc oxide at weaning were also used in the EU for post-weaning diarrhea, but this has been phased out due to environmental and AMR concerns.

Side effects / systemic risks

Same AMR issues as poultry; large volumes of antibiotics used in pigs drive resistance in commensal and pathogenic bacteria with documented transmission to humans.

Nutraceutical alternatives

Systematic reviews and meta analyses show phytogenic feed additives (botanicals/essential oils) in pigs can improve growth and feed efficiency and reduce diarrhea, acting as substitutes for antibiotic growth promoters.

Reviews on probiotics as sustainable alternatives document repeated positive effects on growth, disease resistance and immune status in pigs, suggesting they can support antibiotic reduction strategies.

Practically:

Many pig systems in the EU and North America have removed routine in feed antibiotics in nursery and grower phases, using combinations of probiotics, organic acids and phytogenics plus improved management, and reserving antibiotics for outbreaks.

2.3 Cattle (dairy, beef)

Most used medication classes

Commonly used antibiotics in bovine practice include penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines and macrolides for mastitis, respiratory disease and uterine infections.

In some systems, ionophore antibiotics such as monensin are used as feed additives to improve feed efficiency and reduce bloat/ketosis.

Side effects / systemic risks

Correctly dosed ionophores are generally safe in cattle, but overdoses cause cardiac and muscle toxicity; cross species exposure (e.g. horses eating cattle feed) is dangerous.

Widespread antibiotic use in dairy and beef cattle contributes to AMR, with resistant E. coli and other bacteria documented at farm and abattoir level.

Nutraceuticals reducing antibiotic reliance

Reviews show that probiotics, yeast products and phytogenics can improve rumen function, immune status, milk yield, and reduce incidence of diarrhea and some metabolic diseases, thereby indirectly reducing antibiotic needs.

The broader “alternatives to antibiotics in livestock” literature includes dairy and beef among the species where non antibiotic feed additives have reduced disease incidence and improved performance.



2.4 Summary for breeding animals

In poultry, pigs and cattle, the most given medications are antibiotics (tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, sulfonamides) and, in poultry, anticoccidials; their major side effect at system level is antimicrobial resistance, plus specific toxicities (ionophores, overdose, residues).

A large and growing body of work shows that nutraceutical feed additives (probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, phytogenics, organic acids, yeast products, alternative proteins) can:
• improve growth and feed efficiency,
• reduce diarrhea and mortality,
• support immune function,
and thereby allow reduction or elimination of routine in feed antibiotics and, to some extent, chemical coccidiostats, especially when combined with good husbandry and vaccination.

So across species:

In pets, nutraceuticals are mainly adjuncts that help reduce chronic reliance on NSAIDs and empiric antibiotics in selected indications.

In breeding/production species, nutraceuticals and functional feed additives are increasingly deployed as true alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters and some prophylactic uses, with substantial published evidence – but they work best as part of an integrated management and nutrition strategy, not as simple “pill swaps.”

1. Pets (dogs & cats)

1.1 Commonly used meds

Essential medicines and typical drug classes

• WSAVA “List of Essential Medicines for Cats and Dogs” (2020, updated 2023)
– Lists core drugs for general practice, including:
• NSAIDs: carprofen, meloxicam, robenacoxib, deracoxib, firocoxib, etc.
• Antibiotics: amoxicillin (+/– clavulanate), cephalosporins, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, etc.
• Glucocorticoids: prednisolone/prednisone as essential oral steroids.

1.2 NSAID side effects and safe use

• Monteiro-Steagall et al., WSAVA “Guidelines on the Safe Use of NSAIDs in Dogs and Cats”
– Summarises common adverse effects: vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, GI ulceration/perforation, renal and hepatic toxicity, and notes that only licensed vet NSAIDs at recommended doses should be used.

• Review of NSAID adverse events in dogs (e.g. Papich & others; summarized in NASC / VIN materials)
– Confirms GI signs are the most frequent adverse events, with less common but serious renal and hepatic injury.

1.3 OA nutraceuticals (dogs/cats) and NSAID sparing

• Barbeau-Grégoire M. et al. “A 2022 Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Enriched Therapeutic Diets and Nutraceuticals in Canine and Feline Osteoarthritis”, Int J Mol Sci 2022.
– Shows:
• strong evidence for omega-3 enriched therapeutic diets,
• weak evidence for collagen products,
• “very marked non-effect” of glucosamine–chondroitin combinations, not recommended for pain control.

• Same group’s French summary in Bulletin de l’Académie Vétérinaire de France (2022) synthesises the meta analysis and emphasises that fortified diets and some nutraceuticals provide modest but clinically relevant analgesic effects when used as part of multimodal OA management.

These are the core sources behind “nutraceuticals and joint diets can partially spare NSAID use in mild/moderate OA but do not fully replace them”.

1.4 Probiotics vs metronidazole in canine diarrhea

• Shmalberg J. et al. “A Randomized Double Blinded Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial of a Probiotic or Metronidazole for Acute Canine Diarrhea”, Front Vet Sci 2019.
– Dogs with acute diarrhea: time to acceptable feces was 3.5 ± 2.2 days (probiotic) vs 4.6 ± 2.4 (metronidazole) vs 4.8 ± 2.9 (placebo), no significant difference; authors conclude metronidazole offered no clear benefit over placebo, probiotic slightly faster.

• French review “Probiotiques, quelles preuves d’efficacité ?” (Le Nouveau Praticien Vétérinaire Canine/Feline 2024) summarises Shmalberg 2019 and other studies, arguing that probiotics/synbiotics are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts to metronidazole in uncomplicated acute diarrhea.

These underpin my statement that probiotics can sometimes replace empiric metronidazole in mild acute diarrhea, thus reducing antibiotic exposure.

1.5 Behavioural nutraceuticals (L-theanine, casozepine)

• Pike AL et al., open label prospective study of L-theanine in storm-sensitive dogs – reported decreased severity of storm response with L-theanine; this is one of the core clinical studies.

• Sechi S. et al. “Effects in dogs with behavioural disorders of a commercial diet supplemented with L-tryptophan, α-casozepine and other nutrients” – shows reductions in some anxiety scores; L-theanine also cited for cortisol reduction in anxious dogs.

• SkeptVet evidence review on Anxitane (L-theanine for anxiety in dogs and cats) summarises available trials and concludes evidence is modest and heterogeneous, with potential benefit in mild cases but inadequate data for strong claims.

These support the nuance that calming nutraceuticals may help in mild anxiety, but are adjunctive.



2. Horses – NSAID use and side effects

• Durham AE et al., reviews on equine NSAID use (e.g. Equine Veterinary Education papers) plus student/CPD notes collated in the equine pharmacology literature show phenylbutazone and flunixin as the most commonly used NSAIDs in horses; phenylbutazone strongly associated with GI ulceration, right dorsal colitis, nephrotoxicity at high or prolonged doses.

• Review “Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in equine medicine” (various authors) summarised in VIN/MSD manuals reinforces these toxicity profiles.

These are the basis for my comments about equine NSAIDs and their GI/renal side effects.



3. Livestock / breeding species

3.1 Antibiotic usage patterns

• EMA ESVAC “Sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents in 31 European countries in 2022 – thirteenth ESVAC report”
– Quantifies sales of veterinary antimicrobials by class and species; tetracyclines, penicillins, sulfonamides and macrolides dominate food-animal use.

• Da Silva RA et al. “Regulations on the use of antibiotics in livestock production in different countries” Animals 2023.
– Summarises that most countries have banned antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) and lists which classes are still allowed therapeutically; shows heavy historical use of tetracyclines and other classes in pigs, poultry and cattle.

• FAO “Antibiotic growth-promoters in food animals” – classic paper explaining AGP use, selection pressure and the search for alternatives.

• FAO AMR “Animal production” web page – summarises the challenge of reducing antimicrobial use in livestock while maintaining health and productivity, and lists non-antibiotic strategies.

These are the sources for “most given” antibiotic classes and the AMR context in livestock.

3.2 Alternatives to antibiotics – nutraceutical feed additives

General “alternatives to antibiotics” reviews

• Ibeagha-Awemu EM et al. “Alternatives to antibiotics for sustainable livestock production” Front Vet Sci 2025.
– Comprehensive review of probiotics, prebiotics, organic acids, phytogenics, enzymes, bacteriophages and other alternatives; concludes that combinations of these can partially or fully replace AGPs when management is good.

• Abd El-Hack ME et al. “Alternatives to antibiotics for organic poultry production” Poultry Science 2022.
– Reviews probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, organic acids, essential oils and phytogenics as the most common non-antibiotic feed additives replacing AGPs in poultry.

Phytogenic feed additives

• Murugesan GR et al. “Phytogenic feed additives as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in poultry and swine” Front Vet Sci 2015.
– Shows that phytogenic feed additives (essential oils, herbs, spices) improve gut health and performance and can act as natural alternatives to AGPs.

• Wang J et al. “Phytogenic feed additives as natural antibiotic alternatives in poultry nutrition” (2024, Journal of Advanced Research in Veterinary Science & Animal Husbandry / ScienceDirect).
– Highlights numerous plant extract additives that improve growth, nutrient digestibility and intestinal health and explicitly position them as antibiotic alternatives.

Meta analysis and cross species data

• Comprehensive meta analysis on non-antibiotic feed additives (referenced in Ibeagha-Awemu 2025) – collates data across nine livestock species, showing positive effects on growth performance, immunity and gut health with probiotics, prebiotics, organic acids and phytogenics.

These support my statement that feed additives of this type can reduce or replace AGPs and some prophylactic antibiotic uses in poultry and pigs.

3.3 Policy & sales trends

• EMA “European sales and use of antimicrobials for veterinary medicine – Annual surveillance report for 2023” and earlier ESVAC reports
– Document a 53 % drop in sales of veterinary antibiotics in Europe between 2011 and 2022, largely due to AGP bans and stewardship efforts – indicating antimicrobial reduction strategies (including nutraceuticals) are already in place.

• FAO “Restrictions on antimicrobial use in animals producing meat, milk, eggs” (2023 technical report)
– Reviews policy changes (bans on AGP, restrictions on aquaculture antimicrobials) and non-antibiotic strategies to maintain productivity.



4. Behaviour and anxiety – companion animals

• Pike AL, 2015 study on L-theanine’s effect on storm sensitivity in dogs (commercial product) – shows reduced overall response severity; forms the basis of some calming nutraceutical claims.

• Sechi S. et al. “Effects in dogs with behavioural disorders of a commercial diet supplemented with nutrients affecting dopamine, serotonin and GABA” Veterinary Record Open 2016 – evidence for diet containing L-tryptophan, α-casozepine, etc. on stress markers and behaviour.

• SkeptVet evidence summary for Anxitane (L-theanine) – critical review of all published clinical data in dogs and cats, concluding modest evidence for mild anxiety only.

These give context to my statements about behavioural nutraceuticals being weak but potentially helpful adjuncts.
