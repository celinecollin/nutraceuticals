Here are the updated tables for Section III, specifically focusing on the Microbiome & Startup landscape.

I have added a specific column "Relation to Nutraceuticals" to each table. This explicitly defines whether the company is selling a "true" nutraceutical (unregulated supplement), or if they are using a "Trojan Horse" strategy—packaging nutraceutical technology as a Feed Additive or Ingredient to bypass regulations or access larger markets.
