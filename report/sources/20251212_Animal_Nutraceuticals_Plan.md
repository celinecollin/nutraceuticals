I. Executive Summary and Investment Angle

I.1. Purpose of the report

Position animal nutraceuticals as a distinct investable sub vertical within animal health and nutrition. Clarify what is and is not in scope.

I.2. Key messages and conclusions

Market size and growth. Value pools and margins. Regulatory and scientific risks. Priority segments and deal types.



II. Market Definition and Scope

II.1. Definitions and terminology

Origins of nutraceuticals. Working definitions for veterinary nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, zootechnical additives.

II.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

In scope: functional health products and feed additives with health benefit. Out of scope: pharmaceuticals, commodity feed, pure services.

II.3. Human vs veterinary markets

Differences in physiology, decision making and willingness to pay by species.



III. Functional Segmentation and Use Cases

III.1. Functional segmentation

Joint health. Gut health. Stress and behavior. Dermatology. Immune support. Performance for livestock.

III.2. Species and segment needs

Dogs, cats, horses. Poultry, swine, ruminants, aquaculture.



III.bis. Species Specific Dynamics and Strategic Implications

III.bis.1. Companion animals vs livestock adoption

Companion animals have high willingness to pay and strong vet influence. Livestock adoption is driven by cost per tonne logic and integrator controls. Horses sit between pets and livestock.

III.bis.2. Antibiotic reduction in livestock

Regulation and industry pressure drive nutraceuticals as partial substitutes for antibiotics. Main levers are immune stimulation, microbiome modulation and reduced infections. Fastest growth in poultry then swine then aquaculture then bovines.

III.bis.3. Functional priorities by species

Poultry focus on enzymes, acids, probiotics. Swine focus on weaning and stress. Ruminants focus on rumen protected actives and methane. Beef and veal focus on growth. Aquaculture focus on immunostimulants and microbiome. Pets focus on mobility, anxiety, dermatology and healthy aging. Horses focus on mobility, ulcers and stress.

III.bis.4. Economic constraints

Pets support high margins. Livestock requires low cost and high volume. Horses support premium pricing but remain small. Aquaculture adoption driven by mortality impact.

III.bis.5. Evidence and regulation variability

Companion animals need stronger clinical evidence. Livestock requires compliance with feed additive rules. Aquaculture regulation varies by region.
