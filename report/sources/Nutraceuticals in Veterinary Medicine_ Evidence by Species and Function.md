# Nutraceuticals in Veterinary Medicine: Evidence by Species and Function

## Dogs

### Joint Health (Osteoarthritis)

Joint supplements are among the most common nutraceuticals used for dogs, but clinical evidence is mixed. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, often given for osteoarthritis, have not consistently demonstrated efficacy in rigorous trials. A 2022 systematic review/meta-analysis found chondroitin–glucosamine combinations produced essentially no benefit (“a very marked non-effect”), and collagen-based supplements had only weak efficacy[1][2]. These findings led the authors to recommend against relying on glucosamine–chondroitin for canine or feline arthritis pain[1]. By contrast, diets enriched with omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. fish oil) have shown measurable benefits for arthritic dogs. The only nutraceutical with strong evidence in a 2012 review was omega-3 supplementation[3]. In multiple placebo-controlled trials, adding fish oil to the diet improved clinical signs – for example, one study reported arthritic dogs on an omega-3 diet had improved weight-bearing and could reduce their NSAID dose compared to controls[3]. Green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) is another joint nutraceutical with anti-inflammatory properties. Studies in dogs have shown that diets containing green-lipped mussel powder can improve objective measures of pain and mobility. In a controlled crossover trial, dogs fed a green-lipped mussel (GLM) enriched diet for 8–12 weeks showed significant improvement in peak vertical force (limb strength) and pain scores versus baseline[4][5]. Other trials have also found GLM supplements can reduce clinical arthritis scores in some dogs, though results across studies have been inconsistent[6]. Overall, fish oil and marine-based supplements (GLM, collagen from shellfish) appear to hold the most promise for canine joint health, whereas conventional cartilage supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin) have yielded little proven benefit in dogs[2]. Emerging options like curcumin (turmeric extracts) and CBD are under investigation. A recent systematic review of cannabidiol for canine osteoarthritis found that CBD is safe and may modestly reduce pain, but the evidence was of very low quality and not yet conclusive[7][8]. In practice, many veterinarians integrate joint nutraceuticals with weight management and NSAIDs, but the variable evidence underscores the need for more robust clinical trials.

### Gut Health and Microbiome

Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is critical for dogs, and a variety of probiotic and prebiotic supplements are used to manage gastrointestinal issues. Probiotics (live beneficial microbes) have shown some efficacy in acute and chronic diarrhea, although results can vary by strain and condition. For acute, self-limiting diarrhea in dogs, some controlled trials suggest probiotics may hasten recovery. In one randomized trial of dogs with acute diarrhea, those given a multi-strain probiotic had resolution of loose stools about 1 day faster on average than placebo (3.5 ± 2.2 days vs 4.8 ± 2.9 days), though this difference did not reach statistical significance in that sample[9]. Other studies have reported a significant shortening of diarrhea duration or improved stool consistency with probiotics[10]. Taken together, evidence indicates probiotics can modestly alleviate canine diarrhea, potentially reducing the need for antibiotics in uncomplicated cases[10]. For chronic enteropathies (e.g. IBD), certain probiotic strains (such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) have been associated with improved mucosal health and reduced inflammation in small studies[11]. Beyond live probiotics, emerging postbiotics (inactivated microbes or their metabolites) are also being explored for gut health. A 2025 meta-analysis in broiler chickens – often used as a model for gut health – found that postbiotic supplements significantly improved weight gain and feed intake, though effects on gut morphology were inconsistent[12]. This suggests postbiotics can positively influence gut function, and similar research is now extending into pets. On the prebiotic side, fibers like fructooligosaccharides and inulin are added to many dog diets to nourish beneficial bacteria. While many gut supplements rely on extrapolation or lab studies, there is growing in vivo evidence that modulating the microbiome can benefit canine gastrointestinal health[11]. For example, one study in dogs with hemorrhagic diarrhea showed a probiotic helped normalize the microbiome faster than standard therapy[13]. Overall, probiotics are considered a low-risk, potentially beneficial intervention for common GI issues in dogs, with meta-analyses in other species (like poultry) confirming significant improvements in growth and feed efficiency from probiotic supplementation[14]. Veterinarians often recommend probiotic powders or pastes (e.g. containing Enterococcus faecium or Bifidobacterium) during or after antibiotic treatment and for diarrhea, although optimal dosing and strain selection remain areas of ongoing research.

### Immune Support and Wellness

A variety of nutraceuticals are marketed for “immune support” in dogs, including yeast beta-glucans, colostrum, omega-3 fatty acids, and medicinal mushroom extracts. The premise is that these supplements can enhance the innate or adaptive immune response, helping the animal fight infections or generally “stay well.” There is some scientific evidence to back certain claims. Beta-1,3/1,6-glucans (found in yeast cell walls) are one of the best-studied immunomodulatory nutraceuticals. Research shows that beta-glucans have a marked ability to stimulate immune cell activity across species[15]. In dogs, supplementation with purified yeast beta-1,3/1,6-glucan has been linked to changes in immune markers – for example, improved phagocytic activity of white blood cells and enhanced T-lymphocyte responses[16][17]. One controlled trial in healthy dogs found that adding ~0.14% beta-glucan to the diet favorably modulated gut microbiota (increasing beneficial fermenters) and increased the CD4+:CD8+ T-cell ratio, an indicator of robust cellular immunity[16]. Other dog studies have reported that beta-glucan supplements can improve vaccine antibody titers and reduce inflammation following immune challenges[18][15]. Fish oil (omega-3) is another nutraceutical with immune-modulating effects – by reducing production of inflammatory eicosanoids, omega-3s may benefit dogs with allergic or inflammatory conditions. For instance, omega-3 supplementation has been shown to lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in arthritic dogs and is thought to aid dogs with atopic dermatitis (see Dermatology below). Micronutrients and antioxidants also play a role: vitamin E and selenium are essential for normal immune function, and deficiency can predispose to illness. Most commercial diets are fortified to adequate levels, but targeted antioxidant supplementation (vitamins C & E, carotenoids, etc.) has been studied for specific benefits like enhancing canine vaccine responses or reducing exercise-induced oxidative stress[15]. Overall, while “immune booster” claims should be viewed with caution, there is evidence that certain nutraceuticals (beta-glucans, omega-3s, some herbals) can favorably influence immune parameters in dogs. It’s worth noting that excessive or inappropriate immune stimulation can be harmful, so more research is needed to define optimal use. Regulatory bodies have not approved any nutraceutical as an actual treatment for disease, so these products are used as supplements to support general health or recovery.

### Skin and Coat (Dermatology)

Nutraceutical interventions are frequently used for canine skin conditions, especially allergic dermatitis. Essential fatty acids (EFAs), particularly omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, are well-known to improve skin barrier function and reduce inflammation. Dogs cannot synthesize certain EFAs, so supplements like fish oil or flaxseed oil are given to increase omega-3 intake. Clinical studies support a benefit: in a double-blind trial of dogs with atopic dermatitis, 10 weeks of EFA supplementation (either flaxseed oil or fish oil blend) led to significant improvement in skin clinical scores and reduced itch, whereas placebo dogs saw no improvement[19]. Interestingly, the total dose of fatty acids or the omega-6:omega-3 ratio did not strictly correlate with outcomes, suggesting some individuals respond better than others[20]. Nevertheless, multiple trials (and decades of empirical use) indicate that omega-3 supplementation can have a steroid-sparing effect in allergic dogs – reducing the amount of corticosteroids or antihistamines needed to control pruritus[21]. Aside from fatty acids, other dermatological nutraceuticals include biotin, which can improve brittle hair and nails in dogs with deficiencies, and supplements containing zinc or amino acids to support coat growth (though these are usually only beneficial if an underlying nutritional issue exists). Probiotics have also been explored for skin health via the gut-skin axis. Early studies show certain probiotic strains may reduce the severity of atopic dermatitis in dogs, likely by modulating immune responses; for example, dogs given Lactobacillus supplements had improved skin lesion scores in some reports compared to controls[22][13]. Overall, for chronic allergic dermatitis, fatty acid nutraceuticals have the strongest evidence and are widely recommended as adjunct therapy[19]. They help restore skin lipid balance and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Owners often report shinier coats and reduced shedding when their dogs are on fish oil or similar supplements – subjective improvements that align with known benefits of omega-3s on skin and coat quality.

### Anxiety and Stress

Managing anxiety in dogs is another area where nutraceuticals are used alongside or in place of medications. Calming supplements for dogs often include substances like L-theanine (an amino acid from green tea), alpha-casozepine (a peptide from milk protein), tryptophan, magnesium, B-vitamins, and various herbal extracts (valerian, chamomile, etc.). The scientific support for these remedies has historically been limited, but promising data are emerging. A notable development is the use of probiotics to affect the gut–brain axis. A Purina-funded placebo-controlled crossover study in 2019 found that a daily probiotic containing Bifidobacterium longum (strain BL999) produced clear calming effects in anxious dogs[23]. In that trial, 90% of dogs showed improvement in anxious behaviors (less pacing, barking, jumping) when on the probiotic, compared to their behavior on placebo[24]. Physiological measures also indicated reduced stress: salivary cortisol levels were lower in 83% of probiotic-treated dogs, and 75% had lower heart rates in response to stressors[24]. These results suggest that modifying the microbiome can positively influence a dog’s anxiety – a cutting-edge concept often termed “psychobiotics.” In addition to probiotics, fish oil has been studied for behavioral benefits. A separate controlled trial showed that feeding an omega-3 enriched diet to anxious dogs significantly reduced their day-to-day anxiety-related behaviors and reactivity[25]. Omega-3s may help by supporting neural health and reducing neuroinflammation. Traditional calming nutraceuticals like alpha-casozepine (Zylkène) have some supportive data as well. Alpha-casozepine, a decapeptide from bovine milk, binds GABA receptors and has mild sedative-anxiolytic effects without being a drug. Small studies and owner reports suggest it can help dogs with noise phobias or travel anxiety, though the effect size is moderate. L-theanine (from green tea) has been shown in a few trials to reduce anxiety signs in dogs (e.g. improved calmness during noise events), likely by increasing GABA and dopamine levels in the brain. It is considered safe and non-sedating. It’s important to note that results for many nutraceutical calmers are inconsistent – one dog may improve while another shows little change. For example, modifying dietary tryptophan (a serotonin precursor) was hypothesized to calm dogs, but research has not consistently supported tryptophan-enriched diets as an anxiety remedy[26]. In practice, veterinarians sometimes recommend a multimodal approach: behavior modification training plus a nutraceutical (and pheromone therapy), reserving prescription anxiolytic drugs for more severe cases. The growing body of evidence – especially in probiotics and milk-derived peptides – is encouraging and indicates that nutraceuticals can play a supportive role in managing stress-related disorders in dogs[23][26].

### Cognitive Function and Healthy Aging

As dogs enter their senior years, they may develop cognitive dysfunction (canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome, analogous to Alzheimer’s in humans). Nutraceutical interventions have been at the forefront of managing brain aging in dogs. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a prime example: they serve as an alternative energy source (ketones) for the brain. Several studies by Purina and others have shown that feeding senior dogs a diet supplemented with MCTs can improve their cognitive performance. In one 8-month study, aged dogs on an MCT-enriched diet performed better on learning and memory tasks than control dogs[27]. A large double-blind clinical trial of client-owned older dogs with cognitive impairment found that a therapeutic diet containing 6.5% MCT oil plus a “Brain Protection Blend” (antioxidants, B vitamins, arginine, DHA) led to significant improvement in all 6 cognitive outcome categories after 90 days, compared to baseline[28]. Dogs on the MCT/antioxidant diet showed reduced disorientation, improved interaction, better sleep patterns, etc., whereas dogs on a standard senior diet improved in fewer categories[28][29]. These results confirm that targeted nutritional therapy can help manage canine dementia[30]. Antioxidants are another critical component – an older study (Milgram et al., 2005) demonstrated that a diet high in antioxidants (vitamins E and C, selenium, flavonoids, carotenoids) plus mitochondrial co-factors (like L-carnitine, lipoic acid) improved learning in aged beagles. Many senior dog diets now include such blends. Nutraceuticals like SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine) have also been tried for cognitive support due to their neuroprotective and antioxidant effects; some placebo-controlled trials reported improved activity and alertness in dogs with cognitive dysfunction taking SAM-e. Phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid, is another supplement with small studies suggesting benefits for memory in aging pets. While not every “brain supplement” claim is backed by strong data, the consensus is that nutrition is a powerful tool for brain health in dogs. By providing alternative fuels (MCTs) and shielding neurons from oxidative damage (antioxidants, omega-3 DHA), nutraceutical diets can significantly slow cognitive decline. These interventions are most effective when started early in cognitive aging. Owners of senior dogs are increasingly aware of “brain diets” and often report better engagement and vitality in their pets who are on these special diets or supplements. As with other areas, more research (including long-term cognitive studies) is welcomed, but current evidence supports the use of nutraceuticals as part of a comprehensive strategy for healthy aging in dogs.

### Performance and Recovery

Dogs involved in athletic activities (agility, racing, working dogs) sometimes receive nutraceutical supplements aiming to enhance performance or speed recovery from exercise. While canine “sports medicine” is a younger field, there have been trials on supplements like branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), carnitine, and antioxidants in exercising dogs. One placebo-controlled study on drug-detection dogs undergoing intensive training evaluated a supplement containing BCAAs, carnitine, and vitamins. The results showed improved markers of fitness and recovery in the supplemented group: after exercise, these dogs had faster heart rate recovery and lower muscle enzyme levels (indicating reduced muscle damage) compared to controls[31][32]. In other words, the nutraceutical helped the dogs recover more quickly from strenuous exercise, presumably by providing additional substrates for muscle energy and aiding muscle repair[31][32]. Another trial in endurance sled dogs suggested that a combination of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, selenium) reduced oxidative stress during long-distance racing, potentially improving stamina (though measuring performance in the field is challenging). L-Carnitine, which facilitates fatty acid utilization by muscles, has been studied in sprint-racing Greyhounds and hunting dogs. Some studies found carnitine-supplemented dogs had less accumulation of lactate and recovered their muscle function faster post-exercise, though direct effects on race times were not evident. Greyhound trainers have anecdotally used creatine and carnitine, but formal evidence in dogs is limited. Electrolyte supplements (sodium, potassium, etc.) are given to endurance dogs to prevent dehydration and cramping, similar to sports drinks in humans; this is more nutritional support than a performance enhancer per se. Overall, the strongest evidence in canine performance nutrition mirrors what is known in humans: proper diet and conditioning trump any supplement. However, strategic nutraceutical use can aid recovery. For example, providing a carbohydrate plus amino acid supplement immediately after exercise helps refill muscle glycogen and promote muscle repair in working dogs[33]. The above-mentioned study in detection dogs with BCAA/carnitine showed tangible recovery benefits, like faster return to normal heart rate and reduced muscle damage indicators[31]. Such findings suggest that performance dogs may benefit from nutraceuticals that support muscle metabolism and mitigate exercise-induced stress. It’s worth noting that any substances considered “doping” (even nutraceutical) are regulated in canine sports, so only legal, safe supplements are used. As research in this niche grows, we may see more specialized supplements for canine athletes, but currently the emphasis is on well-balanced high-protein, high-fat diets and basic supplements (fatty acids, antioxidants, etc.) to keep dogs in peak condition.

## Cats

### Joint Health

Arthritis and degenerative joint disease are also common in cats (particularly senior cats), but nutraceutical use in felines is less studied than in dogs. Cats are often given similar joint supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, green-lipped mussel, etc.), mostly extrapolating from canine research. The evidence specific to cats is sparse. In the 2012 systematic review of osteoarthritis nutraceuticals, only one trial in cats met inclusion criteria[34] – highlighting the gap in feline-specific data. Nevertheless, that review noted that adding marine omega-3s to the diet showed some benefit in ameliorating clinical signs in arthritic cats[3]. A more recent development is the use of green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) in cat diets. Studies (including owner-blinded trials) have reported that diets enriched with green-lipped mussel can alleviate mobility problems and pain in cats with degenerative joint disease[35]. For example, in a New Zealand study, senior cats supplemented with green-lipped mussel extract demonstrated improved jump height and a reduction in pain-related behaviors compared to baseline[35]. The anti-inflammatory omega-3s and glycosaminoglycans from the mussels are thought to mediate these effects. Aside from GLM, most feline joint supplements contain glucosamine and chondroitin (often in combination). While direct evidence in cats is lacking, these are widely used to support cartilage. Given cats’ smaller size and potentially different cartilage metabolism, it’s unclear if glucosamine reaches effective concentrations in feline joints; anecdotal reports from veterinarians suggest some arthritic cats do seem more comfortable on such supplements, but this could be placebo effect or concurrent therapies. Adequan (polysulfated glycosaminoglycan) injections are an option for feline arthritis with some evidence, but that is an FDA-regulated injectable rather than an oral nutraceutical. In summary, for cats we have some evidence that omega-3s and green-lipped mussel can help arthritic joints, improving mobility and reducing pain[35]. Glucosamine/chondroitin remains unproven but commonly given. Importantly, any oral supplement in cats must be formulated for palatability and safety (cats are more sensitive to certain ingredients). Owners should always use feline-specific products or veterinary guidance, as cats have unique metabolic constraints (for instance, they can’t tolerate certain essential oils or plant extracts that dogs can).

### Gut Health and Digestive Support

Probiotics and other gut supplements are used in cats much as in dogs, albeit with fewer controlled studies. Cats with acute diarrhea or soft stools may receive probiotic powders (often containing Enterococcus faecium or Bifidobacterium strains). Some trials in shelter cats and catteries have shown probiotics can reduce the incidence and duration of diarrhea, especially stress-related or diet-change diarrhea. For example, one study in kittens found a probiotic supplement hastened resolution of loose stools by about a day versus placebo (similar to findings in dogs). Additionally, probiotics have been explored in managing feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A small Italian study using VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic mix) in IBD cats showed improved stool quality and mucosal histology in several of the treated cats, suggesting a benefit in modulating the gut flora to treat chronic enteropathy. Beyond probiotics, veterinarians sometimes recommend prebiotic fiber (e.g. psyllium) for cats with constipation or megacolon, which can improve stool consistency and regularity. Dietary omega-3s may also support gut health by reducing inflammation in conditions like IBD. Another common nutraceutical for feline digestion is hairball remedies (often a petrolatum-based laxative with added fiber or oils) – not typically considered a “supplement” in the classic sense, but part of nutraceutical care for healthy digestion in cats. An important note on cats: they are obligate carnivores with some differences in gut microbiota from dogs, so not all canine products translate to feline use. For instance, cats often have more Enterobacteriaceae naturally, and some probiotic strains used in dogs don’t colonize cats well. However, a recent review on pet probiotics concluded that administration of probiotics has shown positive effects on gut health in cats, helping alleviate certain intestinal disorders[11]. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains derived from healthy cats are being studied to tailor feline-specific probiotics. In practice, FortiFlora (Purina) is a popular probiotic for cats that contains Enterococcus SF68; it has some evidence in reducing diarrhea in shelter kittens. Also, postbiotic products (inactivated bacteria that modulate the gut) are on the horizon for cats who can’t tolerate live cultures. Overall, while not as extensively researched as in dogs, nutraceuticals for feline GI health are in use and appear beneficial in many cases – owners and vets commonly report improvements in stool quality and reduction in issues like hairballs or food transitions when gut supplements are used.

### Immune Support

Immune-enhancing nutraceuticals are used in cats primarily to help with chronic viral infections and general wellness. One of the most famous (and controversial) is L-lysine for feline herpesvirus (FHV-1). For years, L-lysine (an amino acid) was routinely given to cats with chronic FHV upper respiratory infections, based on the theory that it reduces arginine available to the virus. However, controlled studies have shown lysine is not effective for preventing or treating feline herpesvirus. A 2015 comprehensive review concluded that there is no benefit – and possibly some detriment – to long-term lysine supplementation in cats with herpes[36]. Cats receiving lysine did not have reduced virus shedding or symptoms, leading experts to recommend against lysine for FHV management[36]. This was a paradigm shift, since lysine was a staple recommendation for years. Today, more effective antiviral nutraceuticals (and medications) are considered, such as oral omega-interferon (a veterinary biologic) or immune-modulating mushrooms, although robust data for those are limited. Aside from antivirals, beta-glucans are again a player in cats. Inclusion of yeast beta-glucans in feline diets has been associated with enhanced vaccine responses and improved activity levels in older cats in some Purina studies[37]. Antioxidants and vitamins are important, too – for example, older cats might benefit from coenzyme Q10 or vitamin E to support immune function, though specific studies are sparse. One area of interest is chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats – while primarily a metabolic disease, CKD causes oxidative stress and immunodeficiency. Nutraceuticals such as astaxanthin (a potent carotenoid antioxidant) and fish oil are being explored to reduce inflammation in CKD cats and possibly slow disease progression (some kidney diets for cats are supplemented with these). In terms of everyday immune health, many cat owners use general wellness supplements (multivitamin pastes, etc.) but it’s hard to quantify their impact. It’s worth noting that cats can be sensitive to overdoses (e.g. too much vitamin D or A can be toxic), so immune supplements must be dosed appropriately. In summary, the strongest evidence in feline immune support cautions against ineffective practices (like lysine for herpes)[36], while highlighting that core nutrients (protein, vitamins, omega-3s) are vital for a robust immune system. Novel supplements like probiotics have also shown immune benefits in cats – one study found that stressed cats given Bifidobacterium longum had lower cortisol and less pacing, indicating reduced stress-induced immune suppression[38]. As research continues, we expect more cat-specific data on nutraceutical immune modulators.

### Skin and Coat Health

Cats with dermatological issues (e.g. allergic dermatitis, dry skin, poor coat) may receive similar nutraceutical support as dogs. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil are commonly recommended for feline atopic dermatitis or dandruff. While cats are not as frequently afflicted with atopy as dogs, those that are can benefit from fatty acid supplementation. One study in allergic cats (albeit open-label) noted that fish oil supplementation improved coat glossiness and reduced scratching intensity over 8 weeks, aligning with the known anti-inflammatory effect. Dermatologic diets for cats with skin problems often include enhanced levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, plus nutrients like zinc and biotin. These diets have been shown in manufacturer trials to improve coat condition and reduce miliary dermatitis lesions. Another area is flea allergy dermatitis – some supplements (e.g. omega-3s, quercetin, colostrum) are being studied as adjuncts to reduce the severity of the allergic response when combined with flea control. However, evidence is preliminary. Probiotics might play a role too: a small pilot in cats with allergic skin disease found that giving Lactobacillus casei for 8 weeks led to a reduction in lesion scores compared to baseline, although without a placebo control it’s hard to interpret. Biotin supplementation has a well-documented benefit in cats with seborrheic skin or brittle hair, especially if there’s a mild deficiency. Within weeks of starting biotin (a B-vitamin), such cats often show a softer, fuller coat. Overall, nutraceuticals for feline skin focus on fatty acids and essential nutrients, and these are considered low-risk and potentially helpful. It must be remembered that many skin issues in cats (like itchiness or overgrooming) have complex causes including stress – so a comprehensive approach (parasite control, diet, behavior, ± supplements) is used. Nutraceuticals are one piece of the puzzle to maintain a shiny coat and healthy skin in cats. Many cat owners report that after starting fish oil or skin-support diets, their pet’s fur shedding decreases and the coat has a healthier sheen, which is consistent with the physiological role of dietary fatty acids in skin health.

### Anxiety and Stress

Feline anxiety (from environmental changes, multi-cat conflicts, etc.) is challenging to manage, and only a few nutraceutical options have been examined. Cats can respond to alpha-casozepine (Zylkène) similar to dogs – one open-label study found that a high proportion of cats showed reduced anxiety behaviors (less hiding, improved appetite) during stressful events (like moving to a new home) when given alpha-casozepine daily. Another supplement, L-tryptophan, is included in certain “calming diets” for cats. There is some evidence that a diet with supplemented tryptophan and alpha-casozepine led to lower stress scores in cats in a shelter environment versus a control diet, though controlled published data are limited. The Purina probiotic mentioned earlier (Bifidobacterium longum BL999) has also been tested in cats: early research showed that this probiotic reduced signs of stress in cats, such as pacing and meowing, during stressful situations[38]. This points to a similar gut–brain axis effect in cats as observed in dogs. Pheromone products (e.g. Feliway) are more commonly used for feline anxiety, but those are not nutraceutical (they are environmental). Among herbal options, case reports suggest that its calming plants (valerian, magnolia, phellodendron) may have mild sedative effects in cats, but many herbal preparations are unpalatable to cats. Importantly, cats metabolize compounds differently and can be quite sensitive (for example, kava or high doses of certain herbs could be toxic to cats), so any herbal remedy must be specifically made for felines. Overall, the consensus is that nutraceutical calming aids have a role in mild to moderate feline anxiety, but like in dogs, results vary. Combination diets or supplements (with tryptophan, milk peptides, and maybe probiotics together) may offer a synergistic effect. Owners and vets note that some anxious cats seem appreciably calmer on these supplements, while others show little change – so individual trial-and-error is often needed. Because using pharmaceuticals (like psychoactive meds) in cats can be difficult, these gentler nutraceutical approaches are very valuable if effective, and further research in feline behavioral nutraceuticals is much needed.

### Cognitive Aging

Cognitive dysfunction in senior cats is being recognized more, and nutraceuticals for brain health in cats are starting to mirror those for dogs. Purina reported that their MCT-supplemented “Bright Mind” diet (formulated for canine cognitive health) also showed benefits in aging cats in colony settings[39]. Senior cats on a diet with MCTs and antioxidants navigated mazes faster and had improved exploratory behavior compared to those on a control diet, suggesting enhanced cognitive function. Another dietary factor in feline cognitive health is antioxidant vitamins: one longitudinal study found that older cats fed higher levels of vitamins E and C, beta-carotene, and selenium had better retention of learning tasks and less accumulation of oxidative damage in the brain. As a result, many commercial senior-cat diets now include brain-support supplements (even fish oil for DHA, though cats have high requirements for animal fats). A unique challenge in cats is their propensity for hypertension and kidney disease as they age – conditions that can affect the brain (e.g. cause confusion or ischemia). Nutraceutical support (like omega-3s to protect blood vessels, or coenzyme Q10 for cellular energy) could indirectly help by improving overall vascular health, though specific evidence in cats is not yet published. That said, there was a small study where cats with early cognitive dysfunction were given a supplement combining antioxidants, phosphatidylserine, B vitamins, and arginine; after 8 weeks, treated cats performed better in food maze tests and owners reported more interaction and playfulness than before – an encouraging sign. While this needs larger trials, it mirrors the multimodal “brain blend” approach successful in dogs[28]. In summary, feline cognitive nutraceutical research is in its infancy, but based on analogous success in dogs and some cat-specific studies, diets rich in MCTs, omega-3s, and antioxidants are recommended for senior cats. These can be considered the feline equivalent of “nutraceutical brain food,” aiming to stave off dementia-like changes. Owners may notice improved alertness or routine in cats on such diets (for example, reduced yowling at night, better use of the litter box – common issues in cognitively impaired cats). As always, early intervention is ideal; starting a nutraceutical-enriched senior diet when the cat is middle-aged may provide the most benefit in maintaining healthy brain aging.

## Horses

### Joint and Musculoskeletal Health

Musculoskeletal issues (arthritis, lameness, tendon injuries) are a major concern in horses, and nutraceuticals for joint support are extremely popular in the equine world. Oral joint supplements – containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), hyaluronic acid, collagen, etc. – are given to performance horses and older pleasure horses alike. Despite widespread use, solid evidence of efficacy is limited. The 2012 systematic review on OA nutraceuticals included 5 equine studies and found low strength of evidence for all supplements tested[34]. Some studies reported mild improvements in lameness or pain with certain products, but overall results were inconsistent. For example, glucosamine/chondroitin combination supplements have produced variable outcomes in horses – a couple of trials noted slight improvement in cartilage metabolism or lameness scores, while others found no significant benefit over placebo[40][41]. Green-lipped mussel (GLM) extracts have shown promise in horses similar to dogs. In one blinded trial on horses with osteoarthritis, a GLM extract reduced lameness and improved joint flexion compared to baseline, approaching the efficacy of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory in that study[35]. However, not all horses responded, and more research is needed. Collagen/gelatin supplements (including undenatured type II collagen, or hydrolyzed collagen from chicken) are another category used for horses. There is preliminary evidence that undenatured type II collagen (which may induce oral tolerance and reduce joint inflammation) can decrease pain in arthritic horses, but again data are limited and often come from manufacturer-sponsored trials. MSM, an organosulfur compound, is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects; one equine study found MSM supplementation led to modest reduction in joint inflammation biomarkers, but the clinical significance was unclear. It is generally accepted as safe, and many combination supplements include MSM for synergy. For tendon and ligament support, nutraceuticals like vitamin C (for collagen synthesis) and specific collagen peptide supplements are being used, though evidence is mostly extrapolated from basic science. One interesting nutraceutical is silicon (orthosilicic acid), which has been studied for promoting collagen formation – a small controlled trial in young horses showed increased bone density and collagen content in articular cartilage with silicon supplementation, suggesting a possible benefit for skeletal development and injury prevention. In practice, horse owners and vets often report subjective improvement on joint nutraceuticals – horses may move more freely or have less need for bute (phenylbutazone) when on a supplement regimen. Given the high cost of some products, it’s notable that objective evidence remains weak overall[40]. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) has noted that while many horses are on these supplements, few have undergone well-powered clinical trials, and any benefits are usually mild. That said, because drugs for chronic joint disease are limited (and injections are invasive), nutraceuticals continue to be a mainstay in maintaining equine joint health. Owners are advised to use reputable brands (due to quality control issues) and have realistic expectations. It’s also worth mentioning Adequan (PSGAG) and Legend (hyaluronic acid) injections – these are FDA-approved disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs in horses, not over-the-counter nutraceuticals, but they set a benchmark for efficacy. Oral supplements strive to mimic those benefits, with mixed success. In summary, omega-3 rich supplements (like GLM) and possibly collagen or undenatured collagen have shown the most potential in reducing lameness in horses[6], whereas the evidence for plain glucosamine/chondroitin is not robust (even if they are benign to try). More controlled studies in equines are needed to identify which nutraceuticals truly help and at what dosages.

### Gut Health and Digestion

Horses have a delicate gastrointestinal system, and nutraceuticals play an important role in supporting gut health, preventing colic, and improving feed utilization. One widely used category is probiotics and yeast culture supplements. Horses often receive live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or yeast fermentation products in their feed. Multiple studies show that adding yeast to a horse’s diet can enhance fiber digestibility and stabilize the hindgut microbiome[42]. For example, yeast supplementation has been found to increase the digestibility of dry matter and fiber in horses on high-forage diets[43]. By modulating the intestinal microbes, yeast can promote the growth of fiber-fermenting bacteria in the cecum and colon, leading to better breakdown of hay and pasture. This can be very beneficial for hard-keepers or performance horses needing maximal nutrient extraction. Moreover, yeast may help maintain a more stable hindgut pH, reducing the risk of acidosis when horses consume grain – one study noted that horses on yeast had a smaller drop in cecal pH after a grain meal compared to controls, indicating a buffering effect. Probiotic blends containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus and others are also given to horses, particularly during antibiotic treatment or stress (e.g. transport, competition) to prevent diarrhea. While direct evidence in horses is modest, anecdotally probiotics seem to reduce the incidence of diarrhea (foal diarrhea or post-antibiotic loose stool). A controlled trial in foals showed that a lactic acid bacteria probiotic reduced the severity of diarrhea during a rotavirus outbreak, suggesting improved gut resilience. Prebiotics like MOS (mannan-oligosaccharides) or FOS (fructo-oligosaccharides) are included in many equine gut supplements to bind harmful bacteria or feed beneficial ones. They have been associated with lower pathogenic bacterial counts in feces in some studies. For adult horses prone to colic or with a history of colitis, veterinarians often recommend a daily pre/probiotic supplement as a preventive measure, though it must be acknowledged robust clinical trial data are still emerging. Another common equine gut nutraceutical is hindgut buffers (e.g. calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide) to neutralize excess acidity from high-grain diets – these are sometimes grouped as nutraceuticals and can help reduce risk of hindgut ulcers. Psyllium seed husk is used as a supplement to prevent sand colic in horses on sandy soil: psyllium isn’t absorbed and acts to gel and carry out ingested sand, a practice supported by some veterinary studies. Additionally, herbal gut soothers like Slippery Elm or Marshmallow root are found in some supplements for horses with ulcers or gastritis, aiming to coat and protect the GI lining (though not a replacement for proven ulcer medication, some owners find them helpful for mild cases). Overall, nutraceuticals are a first line for maintaining equine gut health, given the limitations of long-term pharmaceutical use in this area. The evidence from various studies confirms that yeast probiotics in particular can improve feed efficiency and nutrient uptake in horses[42]. A healthier gut microbial balance not only aids digestion but may also reduce the incidence of colic – which is a major goal in horse management. While we can’t eliminate colic risk entirely, a combination of good feeding practices and gut supplements (yeast/probiotics, controlled starch intake, etc.) is thought to significantly help. As feed additive research in livestock has boomed (due to antibiotic replacement), horses have benefited from that knowledge, even though horses are not typically given antibiotic growth promoters. Products originally developed for cattle or pigs (like certain yeast cultures) have been adapted to equine use with positive results in terms of digestibility and weight gain in underweight horses[42]. Thus, gut-focused nutraceuticals are among the most evidence-supported supplements in equine nutrition.

### Immune Support and Metabolic Health

In horses, “immune support” nutraceuticals often overlap with general wellness and metabolic supplements. A prime example is Vitamin E. Horses, especially those without access to fresh green pasture, are prone to vitamin E deficiency which can lead to neuromuscular disorders (like EDM or EMND). Supplementing vitamin E is crucial for immune and muscle health. Research has demonstrated that natural, d-alpha tocopherol in a water-dispersible form is the most bioavailable vitamin E for horses, and that such supplementation effectively raises blood and tissue alpha-tocopherol levels[44]. Studies comparing forms of vitamin E found the water-soluble natural type achieved higher levels than synthetic forms, and subsequent trials validated that adequate vitamin E from these supplements can help prevent oxidative muscle damage[44]. This is strong evidence guiding veterinarians to recommend specific vitamin E products for deficient horses (e.g. those with neurological issues or heavy exercise). Beyond addressing deficiencies, horses under stress (intense training, long transport) may have suppressed immunity, and supplements like yeast beta-glucans or echinacea have been tried to bolster immune responses. There was a controlled study where foals were given a beta-glucan supplement around weaning and then vaccinated; those foals showed higher antibody titers to the vaccine than controls, suggesting an enhanced immune readiness. Omega-3 fatty acids from flax or fish oil can also modulate the immune system in horses – for instance, some studies noted that omega-3-supplemented horses had reduced inflammatory cytokine production and less skin reaction to insect bites (a model for sweet itch). This implies omega-3s help tilt the immune response away from overreaction. Regarding metabolic health: chromium and magnesium are minerals sometimes supplemented to horses, particularly those with metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance, aiming to improve insulin sensitivity. A few studies indicated that chromium yeast supplementation in insulin-resistant horses modestly improved glucose tolerance, although not all studies agree. Cinnamon and other herbal insulin-sensitizers are also marketed for these horses, but data are mainly anecdotal. On the immune front for older horses, coenzyme Q10 has been studied for its antioxidant effect; a recent trial in aged horses showed improved lymphocyte activity in those given CoQ10, hinting at potential benefits for the aging immune system. Additionally, resveratrol, a polyphenol, has been tested in horses with inflammatory airway disease – one study found that an oral resveratrol supplement reduced markers of airway inflammation and improved lung function compared to placebo, pointing to systemic anti-inflammatory/immune-modulating effects. While equine immune nutraceuticals do not have the volume of evidence seen in other species, practical experience and targeted studies support certain interventions. For instance, it’s well-established that adequate vitamin E is essential to equine immune function and neuromuscular health, and supplementation guidelines exist for horses with limited pasture[44]. Likewise, breeders often use colostrum replacers or immunoglobulin supplements in orphan foals to confer passive immunity (a life-saving nutraceutical use, though colostrum is more a biologic product). Overall, in the performance horse world, an axiom is “a healthy horse is a performing horse” – so maintaining immune strength through good nutrition and select supplements (vitamin E, omega-3s, etc.) is considered foundational. Owners and vets should focus on proven essentials (like E and selenium, where deficient) before layering on more experimental herbs. Encouragingly, as with dogs, beta-glucans and similar immunonutrients have shown some positive results in horses and may gain wider acceptance with further research.

### Calming and Behavioral Support

Horses are flight animals and can experience anxiety or excitability in various situations (trailering, farrier visits, competitions). A range of nutraceutical calming agents are used in horses to take the edge off without resorting to sedative drugs (which may be prohibited in competition). One common ingredient is L-tryptophan, an amino acid precursor to serotonin. Many equine “calming pastes” contain tryptophan, and indeed some early studies (in the 1980s) suggested large doses of tryptophan could have a mild calming effect. However, subsequent research provided a cautionary note: one trial found that very high dose tryptophan impaired cognitive function and might have made horses slightly more reactive (possibly by interfering with other amino acids in the brain). Thus, while low doses are likely harmless, tryptophan’s efficacy as a calmative is questionable and not strongly supported by evidence. Magnesium is another popular supplement for anxious horses, given that Mg plays a role in nerve excitability. If a horse is marginally Mg deficient, supplementation could certainly help calm it. Some owners report that magnesium oxide or magnesium aspartate supplements produce a calmer demeanor. A small placebo-controlled crossover study found that magnesium aspartate reduced reaction speed in a startle test (horses were slightly less reactive), but differences were subtle. Herbal sedatives such as valerian root, chamomile, passionflower, hops, and vervain have a long history of use in horses. Valerian, in particular, is known to have measurable sedative compounds (valepotriates) and many anecdotal reports suggest it does calm nervous horses. However, valerian is banned in FEI competitions as it is considered a performance-altering substance (essentially a herbal tranquilizer). There are not many formal studies on valerian in horses, likely due to its competition ban, but it remains in use recreationally. Chamomile-fed horses were observed in one study to have lower stress hormone levels after a stressful event than controls, hinting at a real effect. Another intriguing supplement is theanine (from green tea) – while well studied in dogs, it’s less so in horses, but given the mechanism (promoting alpha-wave relaxed alertness), some equine veterinarians have started experimenting with it for barn-sour or stall-rested horses. So far, evidence is mostly extrapolated or anecdotal. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is often included in calming supplements because deficiency causes nervousness; some horsemen believe extra thiamine has a mild calming effect even in non-deficient horses, though this isn’t proven. In sum, calming nutraceuticals in horses have mixed evidence. Products often combine multiple ingredients (tryptophan, magnesium, B-vitamins, herbs) in hopes of a synergistic effect. Individual responses vary widely – one horse might visibly relax on a particular paste, while another shows no change. Importantly, none of these should be expected to override a severely anxious temperament or replace proper training/behavioral management. But for mild anxiety or for that “extra calm” before a show, many riders swear by certain supplements. The lack of robust trials means we rely on theory and experiential evidence. When choosing a calming nutraceutical for horses, it’s critical to ensure it contains no forbidden substances if the horse competes. For instance, tryptophan and magnesium are legal, but valerian is not. As research continues, we may better understand how to naturally reduce equine anxiety – perhaps the probiotic/gut-brain approach seen in pets could be applied to horses too in the future.

### Performance and Recovery

Equine athletes (racehorses, eventers, endurance horses) often receive nutraceutical support to optimize their performance and recovery. Unlike prohibited performance drugs, these are legal dietary supplements intended to support physiology. A major focus is on muscle function and recovery. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and L-carnitine are given to support energy metabolism during exercise. A recent study on Thoroughbred racehorses tested a commercial carnitine-containing supplement on horses undergoing back-to-back exhaustive exercise tests. The supplemented horses showed better fetlock joint range-of-motion on the second day of exercise and a distinct cytokine (inflammatory) response, indicating improved recovery[45][46]. Specifically, the carnitine group maintained more flexion in their joints (less stiffness) and their inflammatory markers normalized faster between the two exercise bouts, whereas control horses still showed signs of inflammation and fatigue on day 2[45][46]. This suggests that L-carnitine may accelerate post-exercise recovery in horses, possibly by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and reducing muscle damage. Similarly, endurance horses (like those in 50-100 mile rides) commonly get electrolyte plus amino acid supplements during rides to delay fatigue. There is evidence that providing electrolytes (salt, potassium, etc.) and a source of easily used energy (like a glucose or amino acid paste) during endurance competition helps maintain hydration and muscle function, thereby improving finishing rates and recovery times. Antioxidants are another key area: vigorous exercise generates oxidative stress which can contribute to muscle soreness and slow recovery. Supplementing antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, selenium, and co-enzyme Q10 has been shown to reduce markers of oxidative muscle damage in exercising horses. One study in eventing horses found that those on an antioxidant-supplemented diet had lower muscle enzyme levels (CK, AST) after cross-country and recovered muscle function faster than those on a normal diet. Buffered bicarbonate (“milkshake”) was historically (and illicitly) used in racing to delay lactic acidosis; now nutraceutical approaches aim to achieve safer buffering – for example, tribasic sodium phosphate supplements have been shown to increase blood buffering capacity and improved run times in Standardbreds in a controlled trial (and are legal if given well before competition). Another novel supplement is beta-alanine, a precursor to carnosine (a muscle buffer); initial research in horses indicates it can raise muscle carnosine levels and potentially improve high-intensity exercise tolerance, mirroring human sports findings. For joint and connective tissue integrity in performance horses, silicon and collagen supplements are used preventatively (as mentioned earlier) to support bone density and tendon strength under the stresses of training. Moreover, in racehorses prone to bleeding (EIPH), omega-3 fatty acids are sometimes supplemented due to their anti-inflammatory effects on lung tissue; a small study suggested racehorses on high-dose omega-3 had slightly improved lung endoscopy scores (less bleeding) than controls, though furosemide medication remains the mainstay for EIPH. Overall, the performance enhancements from nutraceuticals are generally subtle but meaningful over time. For instance, a horse that recovers 12 hours faster or that can train harder without as much muscle soreness can gain a competitive edge. It’s not an overnight dramatic boost (as illegal stimulants might be), but rather nutraceuticals help the horse’s body cope with the demands of training and competition, thereby improving consistency and longevity. The available evidence – such as the carnitine recovery study – underscores that some of these supplements do produce quantifiable physiological improvements in recovery parameters[45][46]. The challenge is often translating that into performance outcomes (since many factors affect a race or a competition). Nevertheless, top trainers and veterinarians incorporate nutraceuticals as part of a comprehensive conditioning program. Notably, regulatory bodies keep an eye on certain supplements; for example, excessive bicarbonate (TC02) is banned, so “buffer” supplements must be used judiciously within rules. In summary, equine sports supplements focus on fueling muscles, buffering fatigue, and speeding recovery, and evidence from controlled studies is starting to validate some of these practices.

## Poultry (Broiler Chickens and Laying Hens)

### Gut Health and Growth Performance

In poultry production, nutraceutical-like feed additives are heavily relied upon to promote gut health and improve growth and feed efficiency, especially since the reduction or banning of in-feed antibiotics. Probiotics, prebiotics, phytogenics (plant extracts), and organic acids are among the key functional additives. There is substantial scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. Meta-analyses of poultry trials have confirmed that probiotic supplementation significantly improves broiler growth rates and feed conversion. One comprehensive meta-analysis of 48 broiler studies found that probiotics increased body weight gain and improved feed efficiency (FCR) compared to controls; on average probiotic-fed broilers gained weight faster and needed less feed per unit of gain[14]. Although publication bias was noted, the overall trend was clear that properly used probiotics yield a performance benefit in chickens. The magnitude of improvement can be modest (often a few percentage points better FCR), but in commercial production that is economically meaningful. Importantly, that meta-analysis also noted that probiotic effectiveness can depend on delivery method (with water administration outperforming feed) and strain specifics[47]. Beyond growth, probiotics help stabilize the gut microbiota, reducing pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella or Clostridium through competitive exclusion. This improves flock health and reduces diarrheal diseases (e.g. necrotic enteritis). Another major category, phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) – which include essential oils, herbs, and spice extracts (e.g. oregano oil, thyme, cinnamon, garlic) – have shown positive effects on poultry performance. A meta-analysis of commercial-scale broiler trials using a specific phytogenic additive demonstrated a significant improvement in feed efficiency, with birds requiring ~35 g less feed per kg of weight gain on the phytogenic[48]. This suggests the herbal compounds enhanced digestive enzyme activity or gut morphology such that nutrients were better utilized. Indeed, PFAs are known to stimulate digestive secretions and have antimicrobial properties that can modulate the gut flora. For example, oregano and thyme oils have been shown to reduce coccidia and bacterial load, thereby improving intestinal health and nutrient absorption. Prebiotics (non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial microbes) like fructooligosaccharides and mannan-oligosaccharides are also well-studied: they can bind pathogens and improve villus architecture in the intestines, which correlates with better feed conversion. Organic acids (like formic, acetic, butyric acid) in feed or water lower gut pH and inhibit harmful bacteria; numerous studies have shown acidifiers improve growth in young chicks by enhancing protein digestion and reducing subclinical infections. The collective goal of these nutraceuticals is to mimic or replace the growth-promoting effect of subtherapeutic antibiotics – and research indicates that, while they may not equal antibiotics in all cases, combinations of probiotics, prebiotics, and phytogenics can approach similar performance levels. Notably, a 2020 meta-analysis on postbiotics (inactivated microbial products) for broilers found positive impacts on weight gain and feed intake as well[12], underscoring the broad potential of microbiome-targeted strategies. In layers (egg-producing hens), nutraceuticals like probiotics and herbs can improve egg production and quality. For instance, adding oregano or turmeric to layer diets has been reported to increase egg weight and enhance yolk color and fatty acid profile (more omega-3 in yolk). Probiotics in layers can reduce ammonia in droppings (by improving nitrogen utilization) and improve shell quality by aiding mineral absorption. Overall, the evidence base in poultry is one of the strongest among veterinary species, due to the large number of controlled trials. Dietary probiotics “significantly improve growth, immune response, and disease resistance” in chickens and tilapia, as multiple meta-analyses have concluded[49]. Poultry operations worldwide have embraced these findings: it’s now routine to include a blend of these nutraceutical additives in feed. This has not only maintained growth performance in an era of reduced antibiotic use, but also contributed to better flock health and food safety (less pathogen shedding). It’s a prime example of nutraceutical science directly translating to industry practice on a massive scale.

### Immune Support and Disease Prevention

Poultry producers also use nutraceuticals to bolster birds’ immune systems and resilience to disease, reducing the need for therapeutic drugs. Beta-glucans, yeast cell wall products, and certain plant extracts function as immunomodulators. Beta-glucans (from yeast or fungi) in poultry feed have been shown to activate macrophages and other immune cells, leading to improved response to vaccines and pathogens. For example, chickens fed beta-glucans had higher antibody titers to common vaccines (like Newcastle disease) and showed lower mortality when challenged with E. coli, compared to unsupplemented controls (several studies in the 2000s demonstrated this). Similarly, mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) from yeast cell walls bind to gut pathogens (like Salmonella) and also stimulate gut immunity; broilers on MOS have exhibited reduced Salmonella colonization and improved gut immune gene expression in experiments. Plant-derived compounds such as echinacea, garlic, and oregano oil have documented immunostimulatory effects in poultry. Echinacea in water, for instance, elevated white blood cell counts and disease resistance in broilers in some trials. Garlic (rich in allicin) not only has antimicrobial properties but also seems to enhance natural killer cell activity – garlic-supplemented broilers challenged with coccidia had less gut lesion severity, indicating a stronger immune reaction. One interesting approach is using probiotics as vaccines adjuvants: some LAB (lactic acid bacteria) probiotics can carry antigens or stimulate local IgA production, thus improving mucosal immunity. Research in this vein found that chicks given a specific Lactobacillus strain showed enhanced expression of gut tight junction proteins and an uptick in immune cell markers[13], suggesting a more robust gut barrier against infections. Vitamin supplements (beyond nutritional requirements) are also used for immune support – high doses of vitamin E and selenium, for example, are known to boost the immune response in poultry. Chicks on elevated vitamin E have higher antibody responses and survival in face of viral challenges. During heat stress (common in poultry in tropical climates), extra vitamin E and C help mitigate immunosuppression caused by the stress. Another crucial area is gut integrity under stress: butyric acid supplements (a nutraceutical postbiotic) have been shown to improve gut mucosa development and immune gene expression, thereby reducing incidence of necrotic enteritis. Moreover, turmeric/curcumin has anti-inflammatory effects in chickens; in one study, broilers with a curcumin-supplemented diet had lower levels of inflammatory cytokines after a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge than controls, indicating an attenuation of the inflammatory response. In laying hens, omega-3 supplementation not only changes egg yolk composition but has been noted to reduce inflammatory responses in the hens (for instance, hens on flaxseed had lower levels of inflammatory prostaglandins during an E. coli infection trial). To summarize, poultry benefit from a suite of nutraceuticals that enhance immune function and disease resistance, which is evidenced by improved vaccine efficacy and lower pathogen loads in supplemented flocks[49]. Field experiences support these findings: farms using yeast cell wall or botanical supplements often report reduced incidence of diseases like coccidiosis or better survival during disease outbreaks. It’s important to mention that many of these outcomes can depend on proper dosages and farm conditions – results can vary, and one must avoid overestimating them as “cures.” Nonetheless, the push for antibiotic-free poultry has driven extensive research, and we now have a toolbox of scientifically supported nutraceuticals to keep birds healthy. Meta-analyses in tilapia and trout concur that probiotics and related nutraceuticals significantly improve immunity and disease resistance in aquaculture species[49], reinforcing the cross-species validity of these approaches. Poultry, being short-lived and raised in large numbers, show measurable population-level benefits when such supplements are used, making the evidence particularly convincing.

### Stress Mitigation and Other Functional Areas

While gut health and immunity are the main functional areas, nutraceuticals in poultry also address specific stressors and product quality issues. For example, heat stress is a major problem in broilers and layers in warm climates – high temperatures cause oxidative stress, reduced feed intake, and depressed growth or egg production. Nutraceuticals like electrolyte supplements, betaine, and antioxidants help birds cope with heat. Betaine, a natural osmolyte from sugar beets, is often added to poultry diets in summer; it helps maintain cellular hydration and reduces thermal stress on cells. Studies show betaine-supplemented broilers have better feed intake and weight gain under heat stress and lower gut lesion scores (heat can compromise gut lining). Electrolyte packs (with Na, K, Cl, plus vitamin C) given via drinking water during heatwaves help prevent dehydration and stabilize blood pH in panting birds – leading to improved survival and maintenance of egg production in layers. Herbal extracts like peppermint or menthol in water have a cooling effect; some farms spray a diluted menthol solution to lower bird heat stress (this is more a husbandry practice but uses nutraceutical principles). Another functional area is carcass and meat quality. Certain nutraceuticals can improve meat characteristics – for instance, dietary carnitine in broilers has been linked to reduced abdominal fat and increased breast muscle yield, presumably by shifting energy utilization. Vitamin E and selenium supplementation in broilers increases meat oxidative stability, meaning the meat spoils slower and retains color longer (this is important for shelf-life of poultry products). Similarly, feeding hens marigold extract (lutein) or paprika can deeply color egg yolks to meet consumer preferences – a cosmetic effect but achieved through natural nutraceuticals rather than synthetic dyes. These are examples of how nutraceuticals can enhance product quality and consumer appeal. Additionally, pre-harvest food safety is a goal: competitive exclusion probiotic cultures are sprayed on chicks to establish beneficial flora and reduce Salmonella colonization, thereby reducing foodborne pathogen risk in poultry meat. This has a solid basis – a commercial product of gut flora (Nurmi concept) achieved significant reductions in Salmonella in many trials, showing that nutraceutical approaches can align with public health goals. Taken together, in poultry nutraceutical interventions are multi-faceted, targeting performance, health, stress tolerance, and product quality. The extensive research and meta-analytic evidence available make poultry perhaps the best success story for applied nutraceutical science in veterinary species. Producers have largely embraced these tools: for instance, it’s common to include a probiotic + phytogenic combo in broiler feed and a MOS or yeast product in breeder hen feed to pass immunity to chicks. The results at the industry level have been encouraging, with countries maintaining competitive poultry production without growth antibiotics by using these nutraceutical alternatives. Of course, ongoing research continues to optimize combinations and understand modes of action (e.g. which gut receptors are activated by a given herb). But the evidence-based consensus is that such supplements “significantly contribute to growth, immunity, and disease resistance” in poultry[49], validating their essential role in modern poultry health management.

## Swine (Pigs)

### Gut Health and Growth Performance

Swine, like poultry, have seen a major shift toward nutraceutical feed additives to support growth and gut health in the post-antibiotic growth promoter era. Young pigs (weanling piglets) are especially vulnerable to digestive upsets and growth checks at weaning, so many nutraceuticals target that phase. Probiotics for pigs (often Bacillus spores, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus or yeast) have been widely studied. They can help stabilize the gut after the stress of weaning, reducing diarrhea incidence. A meta-analysis of probiotic use in weaner pigs indicated improved average daily gain and feed efficiency in a majority of studies, though with variability. Key findings were that multi-strain probiotics and those given from birth through post-weaning tended to yield the best results, presumably by establishing a beneficial microbiota early. Organic acids are a mainstay in pig nutraceuticals as well – formic, fumaric, lactic, and benzoic acid are commonly added to nursery pig diets. These acids lower stomach pH, aiding protein digestion (piglets have low acid production initially), and they inhibit pathogenic bacteria in feed and gut. Multiple trials have shown that organic acid-supplemented piglets have better growth and feed conversion, comparable in some cases to antibiotic-fed controls. For example, formic acid in weaner diets improved daily gain by ~10% and significantly reduced E. coli counts in feces in a European study, highlighting both performance and health benefits. Phytogenics (herb extracts, essential oils) are also used in pigs. An essential oil blend (thymol, cinnamaldehyde, etc.) was tested in finishing pigs and found to improve feed conversion ratio and daily gain, likely through enhanced enzyme secretion and modulation of gut flora. Another trial with an oregano essential oil supplement in sows showed piglets born to those sows had lower pre-weaning mortality and better growth, suggesting some carryover of benefits perhaps via milk or improved sow health. Enzyme supplements (like xylanase, beta-glucanase) can be considered nutraceuticals too – they break down non-starch polysaccharides in feed grains, making nutrients more available and reducing gut viscosity. Enzyme supplementation is well-proven to improve feed efficiency, especially in wheat- or barley-based diets for grower pigs. Zinc and copper at supranutritional levels historically were used as “nutraceutical-like” growth promotants in piglets (high-dose ZnO is very effective against post-weaning diarrhea); however, due to environmental concerns, these are being limited, increasing reliance on true nutraceutical alternatives. Fortunately, research on synbiotics (probiotic + prebiotic combos) has yielded promising results – e.g., piglets given a synbiotic of Lactobacillus plus inulin had significantly reduced scour scores and higher weight gain than control piglets in several trials. Fermented feed (where feed is inoculated and fermented by lactic bacteria before feeding) is another strategy improving gut health and nutrient uptake in pigs, effectively creating a diet rich in organic acids and probiotics; studies show it lowers pathogenic bacteria and improves pig growth performance. In summary, swine nutrition research confirms that numerous feed additives can maintain growth performance without antibiotics, through improved gut function. For instance, trials replacing antibiotics with a combination of acidifier + enzyme + phytogenic often show no performance drop, and sometimes an improvement in gut health parameters (like healthier gut lining, heavier gut weight indicating better development). Real-world usage in countries like Denmark (with long-standing AGP bans) demonstrates that probiotics and acidifiers successfully keep nursery pig growth on track, validating the evidence in practice. It should be noted, though, that results depend on proper management; nutraceuticals can’t compensate for poor hygiene or inadequate diet formulation. But within well-managed systems, meta-analyses and reviews conclude that these additives (probiotics, acids, plant extracts) consistently improve pig growth and feed efficiency, albeit with effect sizes influenced by weaning age, diet type, and other factors[50].

### Immune Support and Health in Swine

Nutraceuticals are also employed to enhance pig health and immunity, which is particularly important in reducing reliance on prophylactic antibiotics. Yeast beta-glucans and mannan oligosaccharides are frequently used in sow and nursery diets to boost piglet immunity. Sows fed yeast cell wall supplements have been shown to transfer more immunoglobulins to their piglets via colostrum, resulting in piglets with higher passive immunity titers and better survival in the first weeks. Similarly, piglets given beta-glucan after weaning had improved neutrophil activity and a more robust response to vaccines (e.g. higher PRRS virus antibody levels), as reported in some studies. Spray-dried plasma is another feed additive (rich in immunoglobulins) that significantly improves piglet immunity and growth, though it’s more of a feed ingredient than a nutraceutical – still, it demonstrates the principle of supplying exogenous antibodies to support health (and indeed reduces post-weaning diarrhea). Plant extracts with known immunomodulatory action are also explored: for instance, ginseng or astragalus polysaccharides added to feed have shown enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and disease resistance in pigs. One Chinese study found that pigs on astragalus extract had higher IgG levels and recovered faster from a viral challenge than controls. Zinc in high doses, aside from growth effects, is known to directly improve gut immunity (by restoring gut lining integrity and enzyme function), which partly explains its anti-diarrheal effect in piglets. As high Zn use is curtailed, alternatives like zinc in chelated form at lower doses combined with oregano oil have been tried with good outcomes on piglet gut health. Probiotics also contribute to pig immunity: Bacillus probiotics, being spore-formers, survive in feed and germinate in the gut, where they can stimulate gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Pigs fed Bacillus subtilis were found to have increased expression of certain cytokines and mucin genes, strengthening the gut barrier against pathogens. In weaned pigs challenged with E. coli, those pre-fed a Lactobacillus probiotic had reduced gut inflammatory damage and better weight maintenance. Another angle is stress mitigation – weaning is both a nutritional and immune stress. Supplements like L-tryptophan or taurine have been studied to calm weaned pigs; one trial indicated that extra tryptophan around weaning reduced piglet aggression and led to more stable feed intake (social stress reduction can indirectly support immune status by reducing cortisol). Chromium picolinate is sometimes given to gestating sows to reduce stress and improve immune transfer; it’s been associated with lower sow cortisol and slightly heavier piglets at birth in some studies. Finally, essential oils not only modulate microbes but also can reduce inflammation: thymol and carvacrol (from thyme and oregano) exhibit anti-inflammatory gene expression profiles in pig gut tissue. In one study, a blend containing those oils reduced the expression of IL-6 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) in weaned pigs, suggesting a calmer immune state. Summarizing the evidence, numerous nutraceuticals in swine feed demonstrably enhance immune function and disease resistance, which is crucial for pig health management without relying on antibiotics[50]. Field results back this up: farms that incorporate products like yeast culture, beta-glucans, and phytogenics often report lower incidence of post-weaning scours and respiratory infections. Even during disease outbreaks, supplemented pigs tend to have milder symptoms or higher survival. For example, during a PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) outbreak, a farm noted that pigs on a specific oregano+acid supplement kept eating better and had lower mortality than unsupplemented pens – an observational outcome consistent with controlled research suggesting improved resilience. In conclusion, the swine industry’s shift toward these functional feed additives is strongly supported by scientific trials and meta-analyses, which collectively show that such nutraceutical strategies can sustain pig performance and health effectively[51]. This has been instrumental in many countries achieving good productivity with minimal antibiotic use.

### Other Functional Areas (Carcass Quality, Reproduction)

Swine nutraceuticals also target areas like carcass quality and reproduction. For carcass leanness, L-carnitine and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are two supplements that have shown effects. L-carnitine in finishing pigs has been associated with increased carcass lean percentage and decreased backfat in several studies – it appears to enhance fat metabolism and possibly increase muscle fiber formation in young pigs. CLA (a modified fatty acid) fed to finishing pigs consistently results in leaner carcasses and more marbling in pork, as per multiple trials; it also tends to improve belly firmness (important in bacon production) by altering fat composition. These nutraceuticals have thus been adopted in some premium pork production systems aiming for particular carcass traits. On the reproduction side, omega-3 fatty acids (from fish oil or flax) are supplemented to sows and boars. Sows on omega-3s have shown improved embryo survival and litter size, likely due to better uterine environment and reduced inflammatory prostaglandins during early gestation. Boars supplemented with DHA had improved semen quality (higher motility, more normal sperm), which is beneficial for AI studs. Vitamin supplementation beyond basics can also aid reproduction: extra folic acid and choline in sows’ diet has been demonstrated to increase litter size modestly, presumably by supporting fetal development and reducing embryonic loss. Chromium mentioned earlier not only aids metabolism but in some studies increased number of piglets born alive, possibly by improving insulin sensitivity and thus fetal nutrient supply. Plant extracts like maca or ginseng are being explored for boar fertility; maca (Lepidium meyenii) is known in other species for improving libido and sperm count – initial pig trials are small but suggest a potential increase in ejaculation volume and count. Also, mycotoxin binders can be considered a nutraceutical: they bind harmful fungal toxins in feed, protecting the liver and immune system of pigs and thereby indirectly improving growth and reproduction (for example, reducing zearalenone toxin’s negative effects on sow fertility). All these uses show how nutraceuticals span a broad range of pig physiology. It is a testament to the integrated approach of modern swine nutrition: not just meeting basic nutrient needs, but adding functional ingredients to achieve specific health and productivity outcomes. The evidence base is robust in some areas (gut health, growth) and still emerging in others (fertility enhancers, etc.), but the trajectory is clear that nutraceuticals are critical tools in optimizing swine production under sustainable and welfare-friendly practices. Industry and regulatory white papers, such as those by EFSA in Europe, have evaluated many of these additives; EFSA opinions often conclude that a given probiotic strain “has shown a significant improvement in weight gain in pigs” or that an essential oil product “demonstrated coccidiostat-like effects” – these evaluations lend further credibility as they require data from multiple trials. In practical terms, a swine nutritionist formulating a diet today will nearly always include a package of additives (acidifier, enzyme, probiotic, phytogenic) based on the substantial body of research supporting their benefits. This showcases how far the science of nutraceuticals in pigs has come, firmly establishing that targeted feed additives can maintain performance and promote health comparably to conventional drug inputs[50].

## Cattle (Beef and Dairy)

### Rumen Health and Productivity

In cattle, nutraceuticals are predominantly used as feed additives to improve rumen function, milk production, and growth efficiency. The cow’s rumen is a complex microbial fermentation vat, and certain supplements can enhance its performance. Yeast culture is one of the most extensively studied. Live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or yeast culture extracts have been shown to stabilize the rumen environment, leading to better fiber digestion and feed efficiency. Meta-analyses in dairy cows indicate that yeast culture supplementation yields a modest but significant increase in milk yield[52]. In one meta-analysis of 14 trials, cows fed yeast averaged about +1.2 kg more milk per day than controls[53]. Yeast works by scavenging oxygen in the rumen (promoting anaerobic bacteria), providing growth factors, and possibly consuming lactic acid – all of which create a more favorable environment for fiber-digesting microbes. Cows on yeast also tend to have higher rumen pH and fewer incidents of subacute acidosis when consuming high-grain diets. This is crucial for high-producing dairy cows that get energy-dense rations. Probiotics (often called “direct-fed microbials” in cattle) beyond yeast, such as Lactobacillus or Propionibacterium, are also used. In feedlot beef cattle, certain Lactobacillus strains have been shown to reduce liver abscess incidence and improve feed conversion, likely by moderating rumen fermentation and pathogen load. One commercial DFMicrobial product (with Lactobacillus acidophilus) has label approval in the US for reducing E. coli O157 shedding in feedlot cattle – a significant food safety and herd health benefit supported by field trials. Enzymes (fibrolytic enzymes like cellulase and xylanase) are another nutraceutical approach in cattle: adding these enzymes to diets can pre-digest some fiber or supplement the rumen microbes’ own enzymes. Some trials with enzyme additives in beef cattle observed improved fiber digestibility and a few percent better weight gains, though results are variable depending on diet type. Buffers such as sodium bicarbonate are often included in dairy rations to nutraceutically manage rumen pH (especially when cows are fed high corn diets for milk yield). Bicarbonate isn’t a “new” concept, but it’s a nutritional additive that clearly benefits rumen health by preventing acidosis; controlled studies confirm that adding 0.75% sodium bicarb to a high-grain diet significantly increases rumen pH and boosts fiber intake, thereby sustaining milk fat (an indicator of rumen health). Plant extracts/essential oils are a newer frontier in ruminant nutraceuticals. Certain essential oils (like a blend of thymol, eugenol, vanillin, etc.) have been researched as natural analogues to ionophore antibiotics (like monensin) to alter rumen fermentation. For example, some essential oil products have been shown to reduce methane emissions and protein breakdown in the rumen while increasing propionate (an energy-yielding volatile fatty acid), somewhat similar to monensin’s effects. A meta-analysis of essential oil use in cattle found inconsistent but generally neutral-to-positive effects on feed efficiency, with some reduction in methane noted in high-forage diets. Methane inhibitors could be considered nutraceuticals too when they are naturally derived (like fumaric acid or seaweed compounds); reducing methane not only benefits the environment but can improve energy retention for growth. Early trials with red seaweed (a source of bromoform) in cattle have shown >80% methane reduction with no adverse effects, though that crosses into more of a feed additive than a classic nutraceutical. Nitrate supplements (in feed, converting to ammonia in rumen) also cut methane and provide a slow-release nitrogen source – these have to be managed carefully to avoid nitrite toxicity, but represent another nutritional strategy for rumen efficiency. Summarizing, nutraceutical feed additives in cattle have demonstrable benefits for rumen function and animal performance. Dairy cows on yeast/probiotic regimens consistently show improved milk yields and sometimes milk components[52], while beef cattle on similar additives often exhibit better feed conversion and growth. It’s not uncommon now for a dairy TMR (total mixed ration) to include a packet of yeast, fungal culture, or essential oils aimed at boosting milk production naturally. EFSA and other bodies have reviewed many such additives: for instance, EFSA approved a S. cerevisiae strain for dairy cows after data showed it increased fiber digestibility and milk fat yield. These regulatory reviews ensure there’s solid evidence behind claims. While the effect sizes of a single additive can be modest, the combination of multiple nutraceuticals can be synergistic – e.g. a diet containing yeast + buffer + essential oils might yield a noticeable bump in efficiency that producers value. Also, the benefit of a healthier rumen (fewer digestive upsets, more consistent intake) is hugely important for animal welfare and farm economics, though harder to quantify in a single number. Thus, the evidence strongly supports the integration of nutraceuticals in cattle feeding programs for both productivity and health.

### Health, Immunity, and Product Quality

Cattle can benefit from nutraceuticals that enhance immunity and health, particularly in stressful periods like calving, weaning (for beef calves), or transition (for dairy cows). Yeast and yeast derivatives again play a role: yeast cell wall components (MOS, beta-glucan) fed to transition dairy cows have been associated with lower incidence of postpartum infections (metritis, retained placenta) and improved neutrophil function. In beef calves at weaning, supplements of yeast culture or beta-glucans reduced the severity of bovine respiratory disease in several trials – calves on these supplements had higher post-vaccination antibody titers and required fewer antibiotic treatments upon feedlot entry, indicating a more robust immune response. Vitamin E and selenium are classic immune nutraceuticals in cattle; adequate Se-E is crucial to prevent mastitis and enhance udder health. Multiple controlled studies show that high Se and vitamin E status in late-gestation cows leads to lower mastitis rates and lower somatic cell counts in milk[44]. One trial found that cows supplemented with organic selenium yeast had 34% fewer cases of clinical mastitis than those on inorganic selenium – highlighting that even form of a nutrient matters (organic forms are often considered nutraceutical-like due to better bioavailability). Organic trace minerals (chelated Zn, Cu, Mn) are another example: replacing inorganic mineral salts with chelated versions in cow diets has been shown to improve hoof health and immune function (for instance, cows on organic zinc had fewer hoof lesions and slightly shorter duration of mastitis infections, because zinc is important for skin/hoof integrity and immune enzyme function). Choline is given as a rumen-protected nutraceutical to transition dairy cows to prevent fatty liver and ketosis; research confirms it significantly reduces blood ketones and improves liver health postpartum, thereby indirectly supporting immune function and milk production. Chromium propionate was approved as a feed additive for dairy cows after studies showed it reduces negative energy balance and cortisol in stressed cows, leading to improved immunity and reproductive performance. For growing beef cattle, ionophores like monensin are technically antibiotics but used as feed additives; however, there are natural ionophore alternatives like saponins from yucca or quillaja plants that have anti-protozoal effects (suppress rumen ciliate protozoa, which can reduce methane and protein turnover). Some evidence suggests saponin supplements improve feed efficiency and possibly reduce coccidiosis in cattle, acting as a natural growth promoter and health aid. Milk thistle (silymarin) is an herbal nutraceutical sometimes given to cows with liver stress (like those on toxic plants or heavy grain); it’s known hepatoprotective in other species and some vets report improved liver enzymes in cows given silymarin, though formal studies in cattle are few. On the product quality side, omega-3 supplementation in feedlot diets (e.g. feeding flaxseed) can increase the omega-3 content of beef and may reduce inflammation in cattle, but high omega-3 diets are expensive and can soften beef fat (affecting quality negatively beyond a point). However, finishing cattle on certain nutraceuticals like vitamin E greatly improves beef shelf-life and color stability (vitamin E delays oxidation in muscle post-mortem). This is well-proven: feeding 500-1000 IU of vitamin E per day in the last 100 days before slaughter keeps beef brighter red in retail display and slows rancidity, which packers appreciate. Many feedlots now include Vitamin E at elevated levels for this reason, essentially using it as a meat-quality nutraceutical. In summary, cattle health and product quality can be positively influenced by targeted supplements: from trace minerals and vitamins that strengthen immunity and tissue integrity, to plant extracts that reduce stress and microbial load. The literature provides evidence for each – e.g. organic selenium and vitamin E for mastitis reduction[44], yeast beta-glucans for calf respiratory health, chromium for stress mitigation – even if these are not as extensively meta-analyzed as poultry/swine data, the existing studies and field observations align well. Many of these practices are highlighted in white papers or extension guides for dairy/beef producers as “best practices” for herd health without antibiotics. It’s noteworthy that in the EU, some nutraceutical feed additives have received official claims, like a specific yeast product allowed to claim “improved fiber digestibility in dairy cows” or a selenium yeast allowed to claim “enhanced antioxidative capacity.” These regulatory recognitions are grounded in scientific dossiers of evidence. All told, in cattle we see a comprehensive application of nutraceutical science: improving rumen efficiency, supporting immune health, and even tailoring the nutritional profile of milk and meat (for instance, feeding extruded linseed in dairy increases milk omega-3 for a more healthful dairy product – a nutraceutical outcome benefiting the end-consumer). The multi-faceted evidence from controlled trials, farm studies, and regulatory evaluations underscores the important role nutraceuticals play in modern cattle management for both performance and health.

## Aquaculture (Fish and Shrimp)

### Gut Health, Growth, and Disease Resistance

Aquaculture relies heavily on nutraceutical-type interventions to improve growth rates and prevent disease in fish and shellfish, especially as water quality and disease outbreaks are constant concerns. Probiotics in aquaculture are well-established as effective. They can be delivered via feed or directly into the water. Meta-analyses indicate that dietary probiotics significantly improve growth, feed utilization, and immune parameters in fish[49]. For example, a meta-analysis on tilapia found that probiotics generally led to better weight gain, improved immunity, and higher survival against diseases[49]. Common probiotics used include Bacillus species (which can produce enzymes and vitamins in the gut), lactic acid bacteria like Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, and even Shewanella putative probiotics for marine species. These beneficial bacteria work by improving gut microbial balance, outcompeting pathogens, and sometimes producing digestive enzymes that help the host. It’s been demonstrated that probiotics can increase villus height in fish intestines and improve digestive enzyme activity, thus enhancing nutrient absorption[54]. In terms of disease resistance, numerous studies show that probiotic-fed fish have higher lysozyme activity, complement activity, and antibody levels. For instance, carp or trout given Lactobacillus or Bacillus supplements had higher survival when challenged with Aeromonas or Vibrio pathogens compared to unsupplemented fish. Some probiotics can also improve water quality by reducing ammonia or nitrite levels (through microbial nitrification), benefiting fish indirectly. Prebiotics like fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) or inulin are used similarly – a study in shrimp showed FOS supplementation increased beneficial gut bacteria and improved survival against Vibrio infection. Synbiotics (combo of pro- and prebiotic) often have the best results in fish, as prebiotics fuel the introduced good bacteria. Phytogenics and herbal extracts are also popular in aquaculture for immune support and growth. Garlic, for example, has been extensively tested: compounds like allicin have antimicrobial and possibly growth-promoting effects. Garlic-supplemented diets in fish have resulted in improved growth and feed conversion in several species (tilapia, catfish) and also enhanced immune responses (e.g., increased phagocytic activity). Another widely studied botanical is immunostimulatory herbs like Echinacea, Astragalus, or Turmeric in fish feed – these have been shown to increase disease resistance by boosting the fish’s innate immunity (higher lysozyme, respiratory burst, etc.). For instance, rainbow trout fed a diet with turmeric had higher survival when exposed to Aeromonas bacteria. Beta-glucans (often derived from yeast) are frequently used as immunostimulants in fish and shrimp. Beta-glucan in fish feed activates macrophages and other immune cells; numerous trials in shrimp and fish document that beta-glucan-supplemented animals are significantly more resistant to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. One classic example: shrimp fed beta-glucan had much lower mortality rates during a White Spot Syndrome Virus outbreak compared to controls. Because aquatic animals are often reared in high density and exposed to pathogens continuously, these immune-boosting nutraceuticals are invaluable. Vitamins and minerals at high levels can also act as nutraceuticals in fish: Vitamin C is required in fish diets and extra C improves wound healing and stress resistance. Vitamin E similarly improves fish immune response and product quality (fish fillet oxidation). Nucleotides (yeast extracts rich in nucleotides) are another supplement given to early fry and shrimp postlarvae to enhance growth and immunity, since rapidly growing tissues benefit from nucleotide building blocks – studies confirm improved growth and gut development in nucleotide-fed fry. Enzymes (like proteases) in fish feed help when diets contain higher plant proteins that fish digestive systems may struggle with; protease supplementation has improved growth and protein digestibility in species like salmon, which aligns with nutraceutical use to maximize feed utilization. The cumulative evidence from aquatic species is very strong that these interventions matter. Fish farmers have seen tangible improvements: for instance, after adopting probiotic use, many report better growth and fewer disease outbreaks (sometimes reducing the need for antibiotics or chemical treatments). A 2021 review concluded that probiotics and related functional feeds have “remarkable efficacy in improving growth performance, feed efficiency, disease prevention, and water quality in aquaculture”[55]. This is evidenced by both lab trials and farm-scale demonstrations. It’s now quite routine for commercial fish feeds to be fortified with a probiotic or prebiotic. Even regulatory agencies (like in India or parts of Asia) promote the use of probiotics in shrimp farming to manage water quality and disease. On the frontier, scientists are exploring microalgae supplements (like spirulina) that act as nutraceuticals providing pigments, immunostimulants, and protein – spirulina-fed fish often show enhanced color and some immune benefits. Another interesting development is postbiotics for aquaculture: a recent meta-analysis in poultry showed postbiotics can have positive effects[12], and similar research is beginning in fish – e.g., heat-killed Lactobacillus cells added to feed still conferred immune benefits to fish, which is promising for stability and storage advantages over live probiotics. In summary, nutraceuticals have become a cornerstone of sustainable aquaculture, with robust evidence that they boost growth and resilience of aquatic animals[49]. This not only improves production but also addresses consumer demands for reduction of antibiotics and chemicals in farmed seafood.

### Stress Tolerance and Product Quality

Aquatic animals face unique stressors (temperature fluctuations, salinity changes, handling stress) and nutraceuticals can help mitigate these effects. For example, electrolyte and osmolyte supplements like betaine or potassium can help fish osmoregulate better under salinity stress. In tilapia, dietary betaine improved growth in fish exposed to suboptimal salinities, likely by reducing energy spent on osmoregulation. Antioxidants play a big role in stress tolerance: high-density farming or poor water quality induces oxidative stress in fish. Supplements such as astaxanthin (a carotenoid antioxidant, also gives salmon their pink color) have been shown to reduce oxidative damage and improve survival under stress conditions. Many aquaculture feeds include astaxanthin to enhance flesh coloration in salmon/trout (for market preference), but it also benefits the fish’s health by scavenging free radicals. Vitamin E and selenium, similarly, protect fish tissues during stress events like high ammonia or extreme temperatures. One study demonstrated that catfish given extra vitamin E had lower cortisol response and less tissue damage when subjected to a simulated transport stress. Herbal calmatives are less documented in fish, but there is some research into using plant extracts to calm fish before transport (to reduce stress and injury). Clove oil (eugenol) is actually used as a fish anesthetic in handling, but in very low doses could be seen as a calming nutraceutical (though typically it’s a drug use). Quality of fish fillets can be influenced by feed supplements too. For instance, including omega-3 rich ingredients or algae in feed increases the EPA/DHA content of farmed fish fillets, making them more nutritious for human consumers. This is an active area of research given the interest in raising the omega-3 content of farmed fish to match wild fish; feeding fish oil or algae can double or triple the omega-3 levels in tilapia or carp fillets (though feeding fish oil is costly, so algae or flax sources are considered). From a nutraceutical standpoint, that’s enhancing the “functional food” aspect of the fish meat. Off-flavors in fish (like muddy flavor due to geosmin in pond-raised fish) are sometimes mitigated by nutraceuticals: certain clay or carbon supplements in feed can bind these compounds or their precursors, reducing off-flavor accumulation in catfish flesh. Also, supplements like yucca schidigera extract are used in shrimp and fish to bind ammonia and improve water quality (not exactly inside the animal, but a natural additive improving the culture environment – indirectly benefiting fish health). As aquaculture expands, there’s growing emphasis on immune-boosting feeds especially for species like shrimp that don’t have robust adaptive immunity. Shrimp feeds often include immunostimulants like beta-glucan, vitamin C, and sometimes seaweed extracts to help shrimp resist viruses (like WSSV) and bacteria. These have shown positive results, making them standard in many hatchery and grow-out diets. White shrimp fed a combination of beta-glucan and vitamin C had significantly higher survival in a Vibrio challenge test than those without supplements, highlighting the importance of these nutraceuticals in disease-prone species. All told, aquaculture has embraced nutraceutical interventions perhaps more rapidly than any other sector, because the stakes with waterborne diseases and the delicate balance of the rearing environment are so high. The scientific evidence backs this up: probiotics and related supplements not only boost growth but also consistently improve survival and stress tolerance in fish/shrimp[49][54]. This contributes to both economic success and reduces the need for antibiotics or chemical treatments, which is critical for environmental and market reasons. For example, probiotics in shrimp farming have even environmental co-benefits: they can outcompete pathogens in the pond water and degrade waste, resulting in cleaner water discharge. Looking forward, advances in genomic tools are identifying specific nutraceuticals for specific species and life stages (a form of precision nutraceuticals). Already, the extensive research and meta-analyses (like those demonstrating clear improvements in tilapia with probiotics[49]) provide a high level of confidence in these practices. In conclusion, the aquaculture industry heavily relies on the scientific evidence-based use of nutraceuticals to ensure the health and productivity of farmed aquatic animals, making it a real success story for veterinary nutraceutical application.



Conclusion: Across species – from companion animals like dogs and cats, to horses, livestock, and fish – nutraceuticals have become integral to health management and disease prevention. The peer-reviewed trials and meta-analyses cited above demonstrate both the promise and limitations of these interventions. In areas like canine osteoarthritis or feline viral disease, nutraceuticals provide supportive care but are not panaceas, and evidence may be mixed[3][36]. Yet in other areas, such as dietary omega-3s for inflammation, beta-glucans for immune modulation, or probiotics for gut health, the scientific support is robust and continues to grow[6][15][14]. Regulatory bodies and veterinary organizations have taken note: white papers by groups like the WSAVA and AAEP acknowledge the widespread use of nutraceuticals and call for more standardized research and quality control[56][57]. One recurring theme is the gap between popularity and evidence – many pet owners and farmers use nutraceutical products, sometimes outpacing the science. Fortunately, recent years have seen an upsurge in high-quality studies (including RCTs in pets and meta-analyses in food animals) that provide clearer guidance on what works and what doesn’t. Where strong evidence exists – e.g. omega-3s for atopic dogs, yeast for dairy cows, probiotics for poultry – veterinarians and nutritionists can confidently recommend these interventions as part of standard care[19][44][49]. Conversely, where studies have debunked popular supplements (e.g. lysine for cats with herpes), we can update recommendations accordingly[36]. It’s an evolving field, and gaps remain (such as need for more feline-specific trials, or independent studies on many proprietary blends in horses). Nonetheless, the trajectory is positive: nutraceuticals, when supported by evidence, offer valuable tools for preventive healthcare, performance enhancement, and complementary therapy across virtually all veterinary domains. The compilation above highlights both successes (like improved outcomes with nutraceutical-supplemented diets) and areas of inconclusive results. As always, a critical, evidence-based approach is essential – using nutraceuticals in conjunction with, not in place of, appropriate medical care. With continued research and quality assurance, nutraceuticals are poised to play an increasingly significant role in integrative veterinary medicine for years to come, promoting health and welfare in animals while potentially reducing reliance on pharmaceuticals[57].
