III. Species Priorities and Adoption Logics



Why “species” is a financial variable (not just a biological one)

In veterinary nutraceuticals and functional nutrition, “species choice” determines almost everything that matters financially: who pays (consumer vs integrator), how value is proven (quality of life vs ROI), how products are delivered (chews vs premix), and how fast adoption scales (brand pull vs procurement push). The result is a structurally “two-speed” market:

Companion animals (dogs, cats) are high value per animal, brand- and compliance-driven, with strong willingness to pay for prevention and chronic-care support.

Production species (poultry, swine, ruminants) are high volume, procurement-led, and adopt when products reliably improve hard KPIs such as FCR, mortality, uniformity, yield, or regulatory compliance.

Aquaculture increasingly behaves like a hybrid: industrial procurement like livestock, but with a stronger “survival insurance” logic and very high sensitivity to stress and disease shocks (FAO, 2024).

This section explains adoption logics by species group and translates them into investable themes and “what to measure” in diligence.







III.1 Companion animals (dogs, cats): the “chronic care + compliance” engine

Market footprint and why it monetizes well

Europe alone includes roughly 90 million dogs and 108 million cats, and an estimated 282 million pets excluding aquaria; about 49% of households own a pet (FEDIAF, 2025). In the US, 94 million households own at least one pet, with 51% owning a dog and 37% owning a cat (APPA, 2025).

Even when market-size definitions vary (supplements-only vs broader “nutraceuticals”), most public syntheses converge on a steadily growing base: one widely cited estimate puts the global pet supplements market at USD 2.26B (2024), projected to reach USD 3.19B by 2030 (Grand View Research, 2024).

Adoption logic

Companion-animal nutraceuticals sell when they solve one of three “payer problems”:

A visible chronic condition with long management horizons (mobility decline, dermatology, digestive sensitivity).

A lifestyle problem the owner wants to fix quickly (stress, separation-related behaviours, stool quality).

A prevention narrative that feels credible, safe, and easy to administer (humanization, premiumization).

This logic aligns strongly with aging-related issues. For example, osteoarthritis burden rises sharply with age; radiographic OA has been reported to increase from around ~20% in dogs over 1 year to ~80% in dogs over 8 years in large datasets (Anderson et al., 2018). Cognitive decline similarly becomes a meaningful driver of “maintenance purchasing”; review evidence reports prevalence rising with age and commonly cited ranges in older dogs (for example, 14–35% in dogs over 8 years, and higher in very old cohorts) (Kang et al., 2025).

Product economics: format and repeat purchase

Formats that maximize owner compliance tend to win. One market synthesis reports soft chews as the leading form factor (around ~39% share) and dogs as the dominant target animal (around ~77% share), consistent with the “treat-like” administration advantage and the larger dog supplement repertoire (Mordor Intelligence, 2025).

What this means financially: the highest-quality pet nutraceutical assets behave like consumer health brands with (i) repeat-purchase potential, (ii) margin uplift from branded efficacy and palatability, and (iii) strong channel leverage (DTC, marketplaces, pet specialty, vet channel) once proof and reviews accumulate.

What to measure in diligence (pets)

Share of sales from repeat SKUs (joint, gut, calming) vs one-off.

Form-factor control (in-house chew capability vs outsourced).

Evidence strategy (clinical, real-world outcomes, claims discipline).

Channel mix (DTC vs Amazon vs specialty retail vs vet).

Contribution margin by channel (fees, CAC, returns, promos).



III.2 Equine: smaller population, high spend per animal, “performance and risk management” logic

Equine nutraceutical adoption behaves differently from pets and from commodity livestock. Owners and trainers often justify spend via:

performance readiness (training continuity),

lameness and mobility risk management (joint support, inflammation modulation),

GI and stress management (travel, competition schedule),

and reputation risk (quality assurance, compliance).

From an investment lens, equine is attractive when it offers a defensible niche (high trust, premium pricing, repeat programs), but scaling is usually more constrained by population size and fragmented distribution than in dogs.

What to measure in diligence (equine)

Concentration in competitive disciplines vs “leisure horse” baseline.

Trainer and vet influence pathways.

Quality systems and contaminant controls (critical for performance markets).

Customer retention by program length.



III.3 Poultry: scale, integration, and the “FCR + food safety + stress resilience” equation

Why poultry is structurally important

Production species are the volume engine for functional additives, and poultry is often the anchor segment because it is intensive, standardized, and extremely sensitive to small changes in feed efficiency and mortality.

Global feed production provides a useful proxy for where additive volumes concentrate. One widely referenced annual survey estimates global feed output at ~1.396 billion metric tons (2024), with poultry feed ~596 million tons (about 42.7%), followed by swine and ruminants (Alltech, 2025).

Adoption logic

Poultry adopts nutraceutical-like solutions (enzymes, probiotics, phytogenics, organic acids, toxin binders) when they deliver:

measurable FCR improvement,

mortality and condemnations reduction,

uniformity gains,

reduced pathogen pressure and improved food safety outcomes.

Regulation also functions as a demand accelerator, shifting the solution set away from antibiotic growth promotion and toward microbiome and gut-integrity tools. A concrete signal is that novel biological approaches are increasingly entering formal authorization pathways: the EU, for example, has authorized specific feed additives under harmonized rules, including bacteriophage-based preparations for defined use cases (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1390).

What to measure in diligence (poultry)

Evidence package quality: farm trials (scale, design), effect sizes, consistency across geographies.

Economic translation: €/ton feed impact and payback time under realistic commodity scenarios.

Customer structure: integrator concentration, procurement cycle length, technical service capability.



III.4 Swine: the post-ZnO, post-AGP “weaning gap” market

Swine nutraceutical adoption often concentrates around the weaning transition, where gut integrity, pathogen pressure, and feed intake disruption drive performance loss and medication needs. The sector’s demand for alternatives has been reinforced by regulatory constraints on previously common tools.

For example, the EU decided to withdraw oral ZnO veterinary products for pigs due to environmental risk, with Member States permitted to defer withdrawal for up to five years from the 26 June 2017 decision, effectively pushing the industry toward alternative strategies during the transition (EMA, 2017).

Adoption logic

Swine adopts when products:

reduce post-weaning diarrhea risk and performance loss,

stabilize intake and gut function,

and fit modern antimicrobial stewardship constraints.

What to measure in diligence (swine)

Trial endpoints: diarrhea incidence, ADG, FCR, medication events, mortality.

Compatibility with common production systems and feed formulations.

Service model: on-farm technical support often drives renewals.



III.5 Ruminants (beef and dairy): productivity plus “methane and compliance” overlay

Ruminant adoption is often slower because the biology is more complex (rumen ecosystem) and the benefit must survive real-farm variability. But when adoption happens, it can scale through premix and integrator channels.

Two major adoption triggers:

Productivity and health outcomes (milk yield, components, rumen stability, transition period resilience).

Sustainability-linked incentives and requirements, where additives become part of compliance toolkits.

Macro demand for animal-source food is still projected to rise, mainly through productivity gains: the OECD-FAO outlook expects meat, dairy and egg output to increase by ~17% over the coming decade (OECD-FAO, 2025).



III.6 Aquaculture: fastest-growing industrial logic, “survival insurance” dynamics

Aquaculture has become central to global protein supply. In 2022, aquatic animal production was about 185 million tonnes, with aquaculture contributing ~94 million tonnes (51%) versus ~91 million tonnes (49%) from capture fisheries (FAO, 2024). Broader aquaculture production (including algae) reached ~130.9 million tonnes, valued at ~USD 312.8B (FAO, 2024).

Adoption logic

Aquaculture adopts functional additives when they:

improve survival,

enhance stress resilience (temperature, density, handling),

reduce disease losses and improve consistency,

and lower dependence on therapeutics under increasingly tight stewardship expectations.

The “insurance” aspect is important: small improvements in survival can dominate the ROI equation in high-value species.
