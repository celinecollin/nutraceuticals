# Pet Population by Species (2018–2023).docx

## Pet Population by Species (2018–2023)

The U.S. pet population has seen varying trends across species. Dogs remain the most numerous pet, with estimates around ~97 million in 2018 (derived from 63.4 million dog-owning households × 1.53 dogs/household). This grew to roughly 89–90 million by 2020 and has since plateaued near 89.7 million in recent years. Cats, while less common in households, have a large population due to multi-cat homes. There were about 76 million pet cats in 2018 (42.7 million cat households × 1.78 cats/household). Notably, the owned cat population climbed from ~62 million in 2020 to about 73–74 million by 2023, reflecting a recent surge in cat ownership. Smaller pets comprise a much lower share: pet birds numbered only ~5.7 million in 2018, spiked during the pandemic (more households acquired poultry as pets) to an estimated ~25 million in 2020 (approx. 9.9 million bird-owning households), then receded to around 15–16 million by 2023 as trends normalized (about 6.1 million bird-owning homes). Small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, etc.) similarly rose from ~5.4 million in 2018 to roughly 10–11 million in 2020, then ~11 million in 2023 (small pet ownership grew during 2020 and remained elevated)[1]. Pet reptiles were about 4.5 million in 2018, expanded to ~9–10 million by 2020, and held around ~10 million in 2023 as reptile keeping gained popularity[1]. Fish are the most numerous pet type by count: freshwater fish were estimated at ~76 million in 2018 (with 11.5 million aquarist households). This stock grew slightly to about 78 million by 2020 and then hovered near 73–75 million in 2023. (Saltwater fish are a much smaller segment, ~9 million in 2018.) Overall, pet populations 2018–2023 can be indexed as follows (2018=100): Dogs ~100→~92; Cats 100→~120; Birds 100→~280 (pandemic spike) then ~170; Small mammals 100→~204; Reptiles 100→~222; Freshwater fish 100→~96. This illustrates the surge in cat and “other pet” populations in recent years, even as dog numbers remained relatively stable[2].

## Pet Ownership Rate (U.S. Households, 2018–2023)

The percentage of U.S. households owning pets has risen overall. In 2018, about 67% of households had some pet – approximately 84.9 million pet-owning families. This climbed to 70% by 2020, an all-time high equating to ~90.5 million homes, amid a wave of pet adoptions during the pandemic. Pet ownership then dipped slightly as post-pandemic adjustments occurred: around 66–67% of households in 2022 (roughly 82 million families) owned pets[3][4]. Most recently, pet ownership regained momentum – by 2023 it rose to about 71% of households (an estimated 94 million homes with pets)[3]. This recent uptick has been driven especially by younger demographics (Gen Z and Millennials). In summary, U.S. pet ownership rates were roughly 67% (2018) → 70% (2020) → ~66% (2022) → 71% (2023), showing a net increase over the period. For context, this is a significant rise from 56% in 1988 when APPA began surveying. The long-term trend underscores Americans’ deepening attachment to pets, with nearly 3/4 of households now pet-owning[4].

## Pet Food & Supplements Market Size (2018–2023)

Pet Food is the largest segment of the pet industry, and it saw robust growth from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, U.S. pet food sales were about $27 billion[5]. This market expanded steadily each year – driven by premiumization and e-commerce gains – reaching roughly $30 billion in 2019 and about $31–32 billion in 2020 (despite pandemic disruptions)[6][5]. Growth accelerated in 2021–2022 as pet ownership rose and humanization trends drove up spending; by 2022 the U.S. pet food market was estimated around $36–38 billion (retail). Entering 2023, industry analysts put U.S. pet food and treats sales in the low-$40 billions range[7]. (For example, APPA’s report shows $50.0 billion spent on pet food/treats in 2021, growing to $58.1 billion in 2022[8][9].) Overall, pet food dollar sales grew at an approx. 7–8% CAGR over 2018–2023, well above inflation, reflecting consumers’ shift toward higher-quality diets and treats for their pets.

Pet Supplements (Nutraceuticals) – though a smaller sub-sector – have surged even more rapidly. In 2018, the U.S. pet supplement market was valued around $0.636 billion (Packaged Facts). By 2019 it had nearly tripled to an estimated $1.9 billion, in part due to broadened definitions and rising demand for pet wellness products. Growth continued through the pandemic as owners focused on health: 2020 sales reached roughly $2.1 billion (≈0.5% up from 2019)[10]. The boom persisted in 2021–2022, with annual growth in the mid-teens%; by 2023 the pet supplements market exceeded $2.7 billion[11]. (This aligns with Packaged Facts’ report noting U.S. pet supplement sales “over $2.7B” as of 2024[11].) Key drivers have been hip and joint supplements, skin/coat and anxiety remedies, and the entry of CBD products. The 2018–2023 CAGR for pet supplements is ~30%, making it one of the fastest-growing pet product categories[12][11]. Indexed to 2018, the pet food market rose from 100 to roughly ~150 by 2023, while pet supplement sales index surged from 100 to ~430 over the same period – a testament to the “bright spot” growth in pet nutraceuticals[12][11].

## Livestock Population by Species (2018–2023)

Cattle – Beef and Dairy: The total U.S. cattle and calves inventory was 94.8 million head on Jan 1, 2019, the peak of the last expansion[14]. It then gradually declined each year due to beef cow herd liquidations (drought and high feed costs). By Jan 1, 2020 there were about 94.4 million cattle[15]; by 2021 ~93.8 million; and by 2022 around 93.0 million. As of Jan 1, 2023 the U.S. cattle herd had shrunk to 89.3 million head[14][16] – the smallest cattle inventory in over 60 years[14]. This includes both beef and dairy animals. Breaking it down, the beef cow herd (breeding beef cattle) declined from about 31.8 million in 2018 to just 28.9 million in 2023 (a 9% drop in the breeding herd in one year 2022–2023 alone)[16]. In contrast, the milk cow (dairy) herd held relatively steady: ~9.4 million dairy cows in 2018 versus ~9.4 million in 2023 (hovering in the 9.3–9.5 million range)[16]. The beef sector’s contraction resulted in a smaller calf crop (e.g. 34.5 million calves born in 2022, down 2% YoY)[17] and sets the stage for tighter beef supplies in 2023–24.

Swine (Hogs and Pigs): The U.S. hog inventory grew to record levels by 2019 before modestly pulling back. On Dec 1, 2018 there were about 75.0 million hogs and pigs on U.S. farms[18]. The inventory hit 77.3 million by Dec 1, 2019 (up ~3% YoY)[18] and 77.5 million on Dec 1, 2020[19][20]. Hog numbers then dipped amid herd adjustments: Dec 1, 2021 inventory was 74.2 million head (4% below 2020)[21]. The breeding herd had been curtailed, reducing pig crops. By Dec 1, 2022 the hog count was 73.1 million head[22][23]. In 2023 the swine herd began to rebound slightly – roughly 75.0 million hogs were on U.S. farms at year-end 2023 (about 1% higher than a year prior)[24]. Overall, the U.S. hog population grew from ~75 million in 2018 to a high of 78–79 million in 2019, then bottomed out around 73 million in 2022 before inching back up in 2023[25][21].

Poultry – Broilers and Layers: The U.S. produces an enormous number of chickens annually. In 2018, approximately 9.04 billion broiler chickens were raised and slaughtered[25]. Annual broiler production climbed to 9.18 billion in 2019 (a 2% increase)[25] – an all-time high number of birds. It stayed around 9.22 billion in 2020 (essentially flat, +0.5%)[10] despite processing challenges during COVID-19. Broiler output then hovered in the 9.1–9.2 billion range through 2021 and 2022, and was on track to remain near that level in 2023 (with slight growth constrained by higher feed costs). The layer (egg-laying hen) flock was about 389–400 million hens on average during 2018–2019[26]. It dipped to 390 million layers in 2020 (down 2% from 2019)[26], then 389 million in 2021[27]. In 2022, a major outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) caused a sharp reduction in layer numbers – the layer inventory fell to roughly 375 million by late 2022 (about 5% below 2021). By 2023 the laying flock was slowly rebuilding; at the start of 2023 there were ~304 million commercial table-egg layers (down ~7% YoY due to HPAI losses)[28]. (For full-year 2023, average layers were on the order of 330–340 million, still below pre-HPAI levels.) In summary, broiler chicken production grew modestly (2018–2019) and then plateaued, while the egg-layer population saw a recent drop from disease after years of stability[26][29].

Other Livestock: The U.S. turkey population was 245 million birds raised in 2018, then declined to ~229 million in 2019 and ~216 million in 2020 (as producers cut back in response to oversupply)[30]. Turkeys further fell to ~210 million by 2022 before modest recovery in 2023. The sheep and lamb inventory has trended gradually downward. On Jan 1, 2018 there were about 5.23 million head of sheep/lambs in the U.S.; by 2020 this was ~5.20 million, and by 2023 the flock stood at 5.02 million (a 4% drop since 2018)[31][32]. The goat population has also decreased slightly. All goats and kids numbered 2.62 million on Jan 1, 2018; this slipped to 2.55 million by Jan 1, 2022 and 2.51 million on Jan 1, 2023 (about 4% below 2018 levels)[33][34].

Aquaculture (Fish Farming): The U.S. aquaculture “population” is not measured in head, but annual output gives a sense of scale. In 2022, American fish farms (freshwater and marine) produced 663 million pounds of farmed seafood, valued at $1.7 billion[35]. This was up from about 626 million lbs in 2018[36]. Major cultured species include catfish, trout, salmon, oysters, and clams. For example, the catfish sector stocked roughly 300–350 million fingerlings annually and maintained an inventory of tens of millions of food-size catfish each year in this period, yielding ~350 million lbs of catfish in 2021[37]. Overall U.S. aquaculture output grew modestly (by volume ~1.5% CAGR, 2018–2023), constrained by industry limits, even as the number of aquaculture farms increased 18% from 2018 to 2023[38].

## CAGR and Indexed Trends (2018–2023)

The compounded growth rates and indexed trends of these categories highlight where the most significant changes occurred:

Pet Dogs: Essentially flat overall; the pet dog population grew only marginally (CAGR ≈ 0%) as ownership rates plateaued. Indexed to 2018=100, dogs were ~100 in 2018 and ~92 in 2023 (a slight dip). This reflects an aging dog population and a minor recent decline in dog-owning households.

Pet Cats: Strong growth, especially post-2020. Cat population CAGR was about 3–4%. Index ~100 in 2018, rising to ~120 by 2023. Cats saw renewed popularity (closing the dog-cat gap).

“Other” Pets (Birds, Small Mammals, Reptiles): Extraordinary surge during 2020, then correction. For example, pet birds index spiked ~280 in 2020 vs 2018 (as many new owners tried backyard poultry)[1], then fell back to ~170 by 2023. Small pets and reptiles roughly doubled (index ~200+ by 2023 vs 2018) amid sustained interest in exotics[1]. These categories’ CAGR over 2018–23 were high (birds ~15% CAGR, small mammals ~9%, reptiles ~14%), though with volatile year-to-year swings.

Pet Ownership Rate: Overall U.S. pet ownership grew from 67% to ~71% of households 2018–2023 – a CAGR of about 1.2% (in percentage-point terms). Indexed: 100 in 2018, 105 in 2023[4]. Notably, it jumped in 2020 (index ~104) then dipped and recovered by 2023.

Pet Food Market: Expanded robustly at ~8% CAGR (inflation-adjusted ~6%). Index ~100 in 2018, ~140 in 2023[13][9]. Annual growth accelerated during 2020–22 due to premiumization and pandemic pet boom. (E.g., 2020 saw +9% and 2021 +20% in pet food spending[13].)

Pet Supplements Market: Explosive growth (~30% CAGR). Index ~100 in 2018, ~430 in 2023[11]. This niche quadrupled as owners embraced wellness products for pets.

Beef Cattle Herd: Declined about -2% CAGR (2018–23). Index ~100 in 2018, ~91 in 2023 for total cattle[14]. Beef breeding cows index ~100 to ~91 (reflecting the herd contraction)[16]. Dairy cow numbers were roughly flat (index ~100).

Hog Inventory: Essentially flat overall; slight ups and downs gave a ~0% CAGR. Index ~100 in 2018, ~100 in 2023 (peak ~105 in 2019, trough ~97 in 2022)[18][39].

Broiler Production: Low-single-digit growth (~2% CAGR). Index ~100 in 2018, ~102 in 2023[25][10]. The industry hit record output in 2019 then leveled off.

Layer Hen Population: Essentially no net growth or slight decline (~-0.5% CAGR). Index ~100 in 2018, ~95 in 2023 (with a dip to ~90 in 2022 from HPAI)[26][29].

Sheep and Goats: Continued long-term decline (~-2% CAGR for sheep, -1% CAGR for goats). Indices ~100 to ~96 (sheep) and ~97 (goats) over 2018–2023[32][33].

Aquaculture: Modest growth (~2% CAGR by volume). Index ~100 in 2018, ~106 in 2023 (production lbs)[36][35]. By value, CAGR ~2.5% (index ~112) as prices firmed.

These metrics underscore which areas experienced the greatest changes. Pet supplements far outpaced all other categories, quadrupling in five years[11]. Pet food and pet ownership saw healthy growth, boosted particularly by the 2020 pet acquisition surge[13]. In contrast, traditional livestock populations mostly stagnated or declined (notably beef cattle and sheep)[40][32], with the exception of steady broiler gains. The indexed trends highlight the shifting dynamics: Americans are spending much more on pet health and nutrition, even as some farm animal numbers shrink due to industry cycles and efficiency gains.
