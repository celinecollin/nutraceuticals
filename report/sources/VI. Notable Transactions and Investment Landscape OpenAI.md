VI. Notable Transactions and Investment Landscape (2015 to 2025)



Since 2015, the animal nutraceutical, supplements, and specialty feed additive ecosystem has shifted from a fragmented “brand and ingredient” universe into an increasingly structured deal market. Transactions reveal where value is being created (and captured) across the chain:

Companion animal (pet) health and supplements: consolidation around brands, formats (notably chews), omnichannel distribution, and recurring consumption. These assets can command premium valuations when they combine brand power with manufacturing or differentiated formulations.

Livestock and aquaculture: consolidation around “functional performance inputs” (enzymes, probiotics, phytogenics, postbiotics, medicated feed additives, methane reduction solutions) that sit at the intersection of regulation, productivity, and sustainability.

Upstream omega-3 and functional lipids: continued investment and restructuring around alternative omega-3 sources (algal, krill) tied to aquaculture demand and premium pet applications.

Below is a “deal-led” mapping of the most material disclosed transactions, plus the investment logic behind them.



VI.1. Major M&A and Strategic Transactions

VI.1.1 Companion animals: brands, formats, and omnichannel scale

Swedencare acquires NaturVet (US)
Swedencare’s acquisition of NaturVet is a clean benchmark for how premium pet supplements are valued when they combine (1) strong brand ranking, (2) broad retail distribution, and (3) in-house soft chew manufacturing. Swedencare disclosed:

Purchase price: USD 447.5m cash and shares (plus potential earn-out)

NaturVet preliminary 2021 adjusted EBITDA: USD 20.9m (32.7% margin)

Implied multiple: 21.4x 2021 adjusted EBITDA (22.7x including full earn-out)

This is the “pet premium” in practice: high gross margin formats, strong velocity on Amazon and Chewy, and scale manufacturing capability.

H&H Group acquires Zesty Paws (US)
Zesty Paws is one of the clearest examples of a digitally native supplement brand scaling via functional “soft chew” products and dominating online marketplaces. The sale to H&H Group was announced at:

Transaction value: USD 610m

Reported trajectory in the announcement: from roughly USD 3m to USD 100m+ revenue

Vetnique Labs (backed by Gryphon Investors) to acquire Lintbells (UK, YuMOVE)
This deal illustrates PE platform-building across geographies, with a specific focus on science-backed chronic care categories (mobility, gut, anxiety, dermatology). The announcement states:

Buyer: Vetnique Labs (Gryphon-backed)

Target: Lintbells, owner of YuMOVE

Financial terms not disclosed

Wind Point Partners acquires FoodScience Corporation (US), later sold to Morgan Stanley Capital Partners
FoodScience is relevant as a vertically integrated supplement platform spanning human and pet (notably VetriScience), and the transaction chain is useful as a “sponsor-to-sponsor” reference:

Wind Point acquisition announcement (2021)

Sale to Morgan Stanley Capital Partners (announced 2024)

Vestar Capital Partners majority investment in PetHonesty (US)
This is another example of PE targeting premium pet supplement brands; the release confirms:

Majority investment agreed (2021)

Financial terms not disclosed

Mars Petcare completes acquisition of Champion Petfoods (ORIJEN, ACANA)
While pet food is not always classified as “nutraceuticals,” premium pet nutrition is a core adjacency and frequently the route through which functional ingredients are scaled. Mars announced completion of its Champion Petfoods acquisition in 2023; terms were not disclosed.

Mars Petcare acquires Nom Nom (fresh, DTC)
This shows strategic appetite for subscription and fresh formats (often aligned with functional positioning). Deal terms were not disclosed by Mars, but trade press reported a price around USD 1bn (reported, not confirmed).

General Mills completes acquisition of Blue Buffalo
A major strategic transaction that helped validate pet as a growth platform for large consumer groups:

Enterprise value approximately USD 8.0bn (completion 2018)

Nestlé Purina acquires majority stake in Tails.com (UK)
Illustrates the strategic value of personalization and subscription:

Majority stake acquisition announced (2018)

Financial terms not disclosed



VI.1.2 Livestock and aquaculture: specialty feed additives, functional inputs, and regulation-driven demand

Phibro acquires Zoetis portfolio of medicated feed additives and water-soluble products
This is one of the most financially “clean” transactions linking directly to feed functionality, regulatory control, and installed customer base:

Purchase price: USD 350m

Zoetis disclosed the portfolio represented approximately USD 400m in revenue in 2023 and included six manufacturing sites

Phibro later announced completion of the acquisition (Oct 31, 2024)

For investors, this deal is a useful anchor for how “regulated functional feed portfolios” can be priced and integrated by a scaled animal health operator.

DSM acquires Erber Group (BIOMIN, Romer Labs)
A cornerstone transaction in the shift toward higher value “eubiotic” portfolios:

Purchase price: EUR 980m (announced 2020)

Cargill acquires Diamond V (postbiotics)
Diamond V is widely referenced in industry discussions about postbiotics and gut health solutions. Cargill’s acquisition expanded its animal nutrition health solutions portfolio (terms not always centrally disclosed in public announcements, so treat valuation as undisclosed unless you have paid databases).

Cargill acquires Delacon (phytogenic feed additives)
Delacon is a well-known phytogenic player, relevant to antibiotic-reduction strategies and gut performance:

Acquisition of remaining shares completed (2022); terms not disclosed

ADM acquires Neovia (InVivo)
This is a large-scale consolidation of premix and animal nutrition capabilities:

Enterprise value: EUR 1.535bn (announced 2018)

Nutreco acquisitions in premix and additives
Nutreco has repeatedly acquired upstream and midstream capabilities:

Acquisition of Advit (2016)

Acquisition of Nutrimin (2021)



VI.1.3 Upstream functional lipids and omega-3: algae, krill, and structural moves

DSM and Evonik: Veramaris (omega-3 from algae)
The Veramaris joint venture illustrates how strategic players build alternative omega-3 supply for aquaculture (and adjacent premium animal nutrition):

JV announced (2017) and positioned as algae-based omega-3 for salmonids

Aker BioMarine divests Feed Ingredients business (Aker QRILL Company)
This transaction is directly relevant to omega-3 sourcing (krill) and shows how upstream capacity can be monetized:

Enterprise valuation cited at USD 590m for the feed ingredients business

Acquisition structure described as a majority stake by American Industrial Partners (AIP), with Aker retaining a stake



VI.2 Public market and valuation signals

VI.2.1 High-multiple signals in companion animal health

Two transactions provide hard “valuation anchors”:

Swedencare / NaturVet: disclosed 21.4x adjusted EBITDA multiple on preliminary 2021 EBITDA

Zesty Paws: disclosed USD 610m headline value (revenue scale discussed in announcement)

Interpretation for investors: the market pays up when a pet supplement platform owns one or more of the following:

high-velocity brand and omnichannel distribution,

a defensible format capability (soft chews, multi-format),

repeat purchase economics and credible product efficacy narrative.

VI.2.2 UK take-private benchmark: Dechra (animal health pharma, adjacent to prevention portfolios)

Even though Dechra is a pharmaceuticals-heavy platform, the deal is a relevant valuation benchmark for “scaled animal health” generally and often appears in investor comps:

Recommended cash offer implied enterprise value GBP 4.88bn and ~25.9x EBITDA for the twelve months ended 31 Dec 2022 (per law firm deal summary)

Reuters reporting during the process also provides pricing context

VI.2.3 Consolidation inside biosolutions: Novonesis formation and feed enzymes

Two structural events matter for the enzyme and microbial additive ecosystem:

Combination completion of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen, establishing Novonesis (completed 2024)

Acquisition of DSM-Firmenich’s share of the Feed Enzymes Alliance, purchase price EUR 1.5bn (deal completed 2025)
