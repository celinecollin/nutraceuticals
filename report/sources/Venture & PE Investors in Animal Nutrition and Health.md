# Venture & PE Investors in Animal Nutrition and Health

## North America (USA & Canada)

Digitalis Ventures – Venture Capital (NYC & London): Focused on early-stage companies in human and animal health, spanning biotech, health tech, and pet care[1]. Digitalis manages Mars Petcare’s Companion Funds, backing startups in pet nutrition, veterinary care, diagnostics, and wellness[2]. Notable deals include PetMedix (companion-animal antibody therapeutics, acquired by Zoetis) and Native Pet (pet wellness supplements)[3]. Typical investment stages range from Seed to Series A/B (with capacity to lead or co-lead rounds)[1].

Borealis Ventures – Venture Capital (Hanover, NH): An early-stage life sciences investor that shifted entirely to human & animal health in recent years. It is described as “a Hanover-based VC firm investing in early-stage life sciences, digital health, and animal health companies”[4]. Borealis was one of the first dedicated veterinary innovation funds (refocusing in 2017) and backs startups developing novel pet therapeutics and health technologies. It typically partners at Seed and Series A stages to build companies in the veterinary biotech and digital health arena.

Mars Petcare’s Companion Fund – Corporate VC (McLean, VA): A venture fund backed by Mars, structured as a standalone VC firm managed with Digitalis Ventures. It invests in pet tech, nutrition, and services startups[5]. The fund’s focus spans veterinary diagnostics, pet food and supplements, insurance, and wellness products. Notable portfolio companies include Whistle (pet activity tracker acquired by Mars) and Scratchpay (veterinary financing platform)[5][6]. Companion Fund typically takes minority stakes in Seed/Series A rounds, investing around $2–5 million per deal[5], and with a new $300M fund it can back growth-stage pet care companies as well[7][8].

NovaQuest Capital Management – Private Equity (Raleigh, NC): Specializes in growth financing for biopharmaceutical and animal health companies. NovaQuest provides late-stage capital, royalty monetization, and structured investments to advance drug development and commercialization in both human and animal health[9]. The firm has deployed over $2.5 B across 65+ companies in human pharma and veterinary medicine[10]. Notable deals include financing animal pharma programs (for example, supporting Aratana Therapeutics in pet drug development). NovaQuest generally writes larger checks in late-stage or pre-IPO rounds, acting more like a growth equity/PE partner than a seed VC.

Cavallo Ventures (Wilbur-Ellis) – Corporate VC (San Francisco, CA): Cavallo is the venture arm of agribusiness Wilbur-Ellis, with a strong focus on animal nutrition and health. Key investment themes include feed additives & ingredients and animal health diagnostics[11]. The portfolio reflects this focus: for example, Cavallo backed Native Microbials (microbial feed additives for livestock)[12] and Performance Livestock Analytics (farm management software)[13]. Cavallo leverages Wilbur-Ellis’s Nutrition division expertise (livestock, pet food, aquaculture) to support startups, typically investing at early growth stages (Series A/B range) alongside other agtech VCs.

Fulcrum Global Capital (FGC) – Venture Capital (Kansas City, KS): An agriculture and animal health–focused fund based in the Kansas–Missouri Animal Health Corridor. FGC is “the venture capital arm of a U.S. agriculture producer” and targets AgTech, supply chain, and animal health innovations[14][15]. It backs disruptive startups solving food system challenges (e.g. sustainable protein, farm management, livestock health). Notable investments include Resilient Biotics (microbiome-derived live therapeutics for animal health). FGC primarily invests in early-stage rounds (Seed to Series A), with check sizes often in the $1–5 million range, and draws on strategic farm-industry LPs for co-investment[16].

Stray Dog Capital – Venture Capital (Leawood, KS): A specialist VC fund investing in plant-based and alternative protein companies, including those in the pet food and supplement space[17]. Stray Dog’s mission is to replace animal-derived products; it has backed startups like Wild Earth (which makes high-protein vegan dog food using cultured fungi)[18] and Bond Pet Foods (fermented protein pet nutrition). The firm typically leads or participates in Seed and Series A rounds, often writing ~$1–3 M checks. Its thematic focus on animal-free protein and sustainability gives it a clear track record in pet nutrition and nutraceutical investments.

Tyson Ventures – Corporate VC (Springdale, AR): The venture investment arm of Tyson Foods, with a mandate to “transform the food industry” through new protein sources and food tech[19]. Tyson Ventures focuses on alternative proteins, sustainability, and nutrition – which has included investments benefiting the animal nutrition sector. For example, Tyson was an early backer of Future Meat/Upside Foods (cultivated meat) and invested in MycoTechnology (fermented protein) to explore pet food applications[20][21]. It also participated in funding Wild Earth’s meatless pet food concept alongside other VCs[18]. Tyson Ventures generally targets Series A/B stage opportunities, with $2–10 M equity checks, aiming to partner with startups that can supply or complement Tyson’s pet food and feed ingredients business.

S2G Ventures (Seed 2 Growth) – Venture Capital (Chicago, IL): A leading agrifood-tech investor with broad coverage from farm to fork. S2G has a strong sustainability thesis and has actively invested in animal nutrition innovations such as insect-based feed and alternative pet foods. It co-led a recent investment in Enthos (a Colombian startup using black soldier fly larvae to produce protein-rich feed meal for aquaculture and livestock)[22]. S2G operates as a multi-stage fund: it invests from Seed up to Growth (Series B/C), with check sizes roughly $100K up to $5–10 M[23]. Notable portfolio companies in this vertical include EnviroFlight (insect feed), Apeel (food preservation affecting feed supply), and Beyond Meat (plant-based protein impacting pet and animal feed markets)[24][25].

## Europe (Continental EU)

Anterra Capital – Venture Capital (Amsterdam & Boston): Anterra is a food and agriculture tech investor with a specific focus on animal health & nutrition. The firm “invests in global health and nutrition… backing tech-driven solutions for sustainable food systems, animal health, and ag innovation”[26]. Anterra has raised a $260 M agrifood fund and typically invests at Series A and B stages (typical check $1–10 M)[27]. Notable portfolio companies include Invetx (Boston-based developer of protein therapeutics for pets, which Anterra incubated[28]) and Animol Discovery (animal pharma R&D platform). Anterra’s track record in both Europe and North America makes it a prominent specialist in animal nutrition and health venture investing.

Seventure Partners (Adisseo AVF) – Venture Capital (Paris): Seventure is a life-sciences VC known for its microbiome funds. In 2018 it launched the Animal Nutrition and Health Fund (AVF) in partnership with feed-additive maker Adisseo[29]. This fund (€24 M at first close) invests in startups improving animal feed sustainability, health, and traceability across Europe, North America, and Israel[30][31]. The AVF targets innovations like probiotics for livestock, novel feed ingredients, diagnostics, and farm management tools to make animal protein production more sustainable. As a smaller thematic fund, it focuses on early-stage investments (Seed/Series A). For example, AVF has backed companies like Biomodex (animal gut health solutions) and Algoxan (algal feed additives). Seventure’s typical check size in AVF is in the €1–3 M range, often co-investing with strategic corporates (like Adisseo) in the animal feed sector[30].

Nutreco NuFrontiers – Corporate VC (NL): NuFrontiers is the corporate venturing arm of Nutreco, one of the world’s largest animal nutrition companies. It actively invests in feed and food tech startups to drive innovation in livestock and aquaculture nutrition[32]. NuFrontiers’ portfolio includes ventures such as BiomEdit (microbiome-based animal health products, spun out of Elanco) and Mosa Meat (cultured meat, to eventually replace animal feed demand)[33]. It has also invested in novel feed ingredients (e.g. algal proteins, insect meal). As a strategic investor, Nutreco provides not just capital but industry expertise and often partners at the growth stage (Series B onwards) to scale technologies that align with sustainable feed and additive development[32]. (For instance, Nutreco has backed ViAqua for shrimp health and ENORM for insect protein). Check sizes are not always disclosed but are typically a few million dollars, with Nutreco often joining later-stage rounds as a key strategic backer.

Aqua-Spark – Venture Capital (Utrecht, NL): The world’s largest fund dedicated to sustainable aquaculture, with a global investor base[34]. Aqua-Spark invests in companies across aquaculture value chains, including fish nutrition and feed additives. It has funded innovations like microalgae-based astaxanthin alternatives (to replace synthetic salmon feed additives)[35] and gas-fermentation platforms producing single-cell protein for aquafeed (e.g. NovoNutrients, developing nutraceutical feed additives)[36]. Aqua-Spark typically writes Series A/B checks (≈$1–5 M) and often leads rounds in its niche. Its notable portfolio in feed/nutrition includes Calysta (microbial protein for fish feed), Protix (insect meal producer), and Ecto (shrimp feed additives). The fund focuses on long-term, patient capital—aiming for financial returns alongside measurable sustainability impact in animal nutrition.

Blue Horizon Ventures – Venture Capital (Zurich, CH): A European fund centered on alternative proteins and sustainable food, with activity in pet nutrition. Blue Horizon has a broad mandate (plant-based, fermentation, cultivated meat) and has actively invested in companies like Wild Earth – which is using biotech to create cultured protein pet foods[37]. Blue Horizon’s thesis is that pet food can be made more sustainable through alternative ingredients, paralleling human food trends[37]. Other relevant investments include Because, Animals (cultured mouse meat for cat food) and Bond Pet Foods (microbial fermentation for pet protein). The fund usually invests at Series A stage (typical check $2–8 M) and often co-invests with North American VCs on deals in this sector. Its focus on food-tech innovation (not exclusively pet or feed) gives it a broader strategy that includes animal nutraceuticals as part of health & wellness trends.

## United Kingdom

Ocean 14 Capital – Growth VC/PE (London): A blue-economy investment firm with a €150 M fund dedicated to ocean sustainability. Ocean 14 targets aquaculture and marine innovation, including sustainable feed solutions for farmed fish. In 2023 it partnered with S2G to back Enthos – an insect protein producer converting waste to animal feed in Latin America[22]. This reflects Ocean 14’s focus on alternatives to wild fishmeal and other feed additives that impact ocean health. The fund typically provides growth-stage capital (Series B and up), deploying multi-million-Euro investments to scale technologies like insect farms, algae cultivation, and novel feed additives[38][39]. Ocean 14’s portfolio also includes Veramaris (algal omega-3 for fish feed) and Sea6 Energy (seaweed-derived feed inputs). Headquarters are in London, with a remit to invest globally in innovations benefiting aquatic food supply chains.

Cibus Fund (ADM Capital) – Private Equity (London): A sustainable food and agriculture fund headquartered in the UK, known for mid-market investments. Cibus has a strong track record in animal nutrition and feed companies. For example, it led a financing round for Enterra Feed Corp, a Canadian insect protein manufacturer for pet food, poultry, and aquaculture feeds[40]. Cibus’s primary focus is on growth-stage and buyout opportunities in food supply chains[41]. It typically takes significant minority or controlling stakes in companies (investment sizes often $10–30 M). In the animal health arena, Cibus has also invested in PharmaZen (nutraceutical ingredients) and signaled interest in veterinary and aquaculture deals[42]. The fund’s strategy is to back companies employing “smart, sustainable technologies” in protein production and feed efficiency[43], aligning financial returns with ESG goals in animal nutrition.

Digitalis Ventures (UK) – Venture Capital (London & New York): (See Digitalis under North America.) Digitalis maintains a London office and actively invests in UK and European animal health startups. For instance, it backed PetMedix in Cambridge (developing antibody therapies for pets) and Napo in London (pet insurance with wellness focus)[44]. Digitalis brings a transatlantic approach, often co-investing with UK funds at Seed/Series A. Check sizes range from ~$1 M seed tickets to $5–10 M in Series B, depending on the opportunity. Its UK presence via the Mars Companion Fund and partnerships (e.g. the Leap Venture Studio accelerator in London) makes it a key player in the British pet tech and health ecosystem[2].

Mercia & University Funds – Venture Capital (various UK regions): Several UK generalist funds have developed specialty practices in pet and agri-tech. For example, Mercia Asset Management (an early-stage investor) has backed pet health startups like Napo (lead in a £12 M round for pet insurance/wellness)[44]. Cambridge Innovation Capital (CIC) invested in PetMedix (Cambridge’s spin-out in animal biotech). While these are not dedicated animal-health funds, they contribute to the UK’s animal nutrition space through active deals. They typically invest at Seed to Series A with £500k–£5 M checks, leveraging UK research strengths in biotech and veterinary science. These generalist funds are included here for completeness but tend to have one-off deals in the vertical (unlike the specialist firms above). Priority is given to the dedicated and repeat investors in animal nutrition and supplements.

Sources: Venture fund websites and press releases were used to confirm each firm’s focus and investments (e.g. Digitalis’s dual focus on human/animal health[1], Mars Companion Fund’s strategy[5], Anterra’s agtech mandate[26], and Cibus’s insect-feed investment[40]). These sources illustrate the clear track records these investors have in animal nutrition, pet supplements, feed additives, and nutraceuticals within North America and Europe. Each firm listed has multiple engagements in this vertical, distinguishing them from generalist funds with only occasional deals.
