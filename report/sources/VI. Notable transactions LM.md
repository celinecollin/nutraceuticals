# VI. Notable transactions LM.docx

The animal nutraceutical sector has transitioned into a major arena for capital allocation, defined by high-multiples in the pet segment and strategic consolidation in livestock efficiency. The following sections detail the notable transactions and the investment landscape over the past decade.



VI.1. Major M&A and IPO Transactions

The category is currently shaped by a "post-antibiotic pivot", where pharmaceutical incumbents and food giants are acquiring biotech-driven nutrition assets to secure defensive moats and high-growth revenue streams.

• Strategic Industrial Realignment: In one of the most significant livestock-focused deals, Phibro Animal Health acquired Zoetis’s Medicated Feed Additive (MFA) portfolio and water-soluble products in late 2024 for $350 million in cash. This transaction included over 37 product lines sold in 80 countries and six manufacturing sites. Simultaneously, dsm-firmenich executed a major restructuring, selling its stake in the Feed Enzyme Alliance to Novonesis for €1.5 billion in June 2025. This followed the landmark €9.1 billion merger between Novozymes and Chr. Hansen in 2024 to form Novonesis, creating a global powerhouse in biosolutions and microbial health.

• The "Pet Premium" Consolidation: The $610 million acquisition of **Zesty Paws by H&H Group** in 2021 remains a benchmark, valuing a digital-first pet supplement brand at a multiple typically reserved for high-growth tech firms$448 million in 2022), Summit Veterinary Pharmaceuticals (£30 million in 2025), and Riley’s Organics.

• Vertical Integration by "Big Food": Mars Petcare has aggressively vertically integrated, acquiring Champion Petfoods (Orijen/Acana) and fresh-food pioneer Nom Nom. General Mills entered the space through its $8 billion acquisition of Blue Buffalo in 2018, while Nestlé Purina secured a majority stake in personalized nutrition firm Tails.com and acquired Red Collar’s functional treats factory in 2023.

• Recent IPOs: Smithfield Foods completed a significant Initial Public Offering on the Nasdaq in January 2025, raising approximately $236 million in net proceeds. Earlier, Aker BioMarine listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (2020–2021), focusing on sustainably sourced krill-derived Omega-3s for the pet and aquaculture markets.



VI.2. Active VC and PE Firms in the Category

Venture capital and private equity activity is bifurcated between early-stage "disruptors" in the microbiome and alternative protein space and large-scale "buy-and-build" platform plays.

• Specialist Venture Capital:

    ◦ Digitalis Ventures / Mars Companion Fund: Manages a $300 million fund focused on pet tech, nutrition, and wellness. Portfolio highlights include PetMedix (acquired by Zoetis) and Native Pet.

    ◦ Anterra Capital: A leading agrifood investor with a specific animal health mandate, having incubated firms like Invetx (protein therapeutics).

    ◦ Aqua-Spark: The primary fund for sustainable aquaculture, backing innovations like algae-based astaxanthin and single-cell proteins.

    ◦ Stray Dog Capital and S2G Ventures: Focus on sustainability-driven disruptions, including insect-based meal and plant-based pet nutrition (e.g., Wild Earth and Enthos).

• Corporate Venture Capital (CVC):

    ◦ Nutreco NuFrontiers: Actively invests in microbiome biotech, such as BiomEdit, and alternative proteins like Mosa Meat.

    ◦ Cavallo Ventures (Wilbur-Ellis): Targets early growth stages in feed additives, backing firms like Native Microbials.

• Private Equity and Growth Equity:

    ◦ EQT & Luxinva (ADIA): Executed one of the largest sector deals by taking Dechra Pharmaceuticals private in 2023 for approximately £4.5 billion.

    ◦ NovaQuest Capital Management: Specializes in late-stage capital and royalty monetization, supporting firms like Aratana Therapeutics.

    ◦ Cibus Fund (ADM Capital): Actively leads financings for sustainable animal nutrition, including Enterra Feed Corp (insect protein).







To conceptualise this transaction landscape, consider it as a global game of "Biological Monopoly". The Global Integrators (Mars, Nestlé) are buying up the high-value "Boardwalk" properties (premium pet brands and veterinary ecosystems); the Pharma Incumbents (Zoetis, Elanco) are trading their older industrial "utilities" (MFA portfolios) to double down on high-tech innovation; and the Specialist Funds are the "Seed Investors" funding the next generation of players on the board.
