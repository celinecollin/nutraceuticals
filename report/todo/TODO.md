Below is a detailed, publication‑ready punch list to bring your nutraceuticals WIP up to the same “finished equity research white paper” standard as the data centres PDF.

I’m using your data centres paper as the benchmark for: (1) navigability and structure (TOC, section openers), (2) visual density and chart quality with sources, (3) explicit methodology and “original work” elements (like the capex tracker), and (4) production polish (author page + legal/distribution language). For example, the data centres piece has a Table of Content with page numbers and clear section architecture, a tight executive summary that explains the framework and the “why this paper exists” question, explicit methodology (the tracker aggregating Bloomberg capex consensus across ~50 companies), figure-by-figure sourcing, and a full author + legal disclaimer section.

Your nutraceuticals WIP already has strong raw material: a clear positioning on “two secular trends” and a “two-speed” market framing, plus a lot of domain depth across regulatory, segmentation, market synthesis, and competitive mapping. What’s holding it back vs the data centres PDF is mostly: (a) final structure and navigation, (b) “figure completion” and consistent chart sourcing, (c) citation hygiene, and (d) tightening a few scope/numbering inconsistencies and production artifacts (markdown remnants, broken reference tags, copy issues).

## 1) Priority 0 checklist: must-fix items before this can be “final PDF quality”

### 1.1 Resolve scope and market size coherence

Your cover/exec positioning currently creates avoidable confusion:

* The cover frames a “$6 billion global industry” and “$6+ billion industry projected to reach $10–14 billion”.
* In the Key Findings you state pet nutraceuticals are $5.8–6.2B and livestock feed additives are $7–8B (which implies a combined “animal nutraceutical” opportunity well above $6B).

**To do**

* [ ] Decide the primary “headline market” definition and stick to it everywhere (cover, exec summary, Part III TAM/SAM/SOM, charts).

  * Option A: “Animal nutraceuticals” = pet supplements + livestock functional additives (big combined TAM).
  * Option B: “Animal nutraceuticals” headline = pet nutraceuticals only (keep livestock as a second market in the paper).
* [ ] Create a single, explicit “Market definition box” early (within Part I) with:

  * Included segments
  * Excluded segments
  * Boundary decisions (OTC vs Rx, feed additive vs veterinary drug, functional treats, etc)
  * The exact segments used in each TAM line item
* [ ] Build a “reconciliation table” (1 page) showing how you bridge:

  * Global pet + animal health market (your $123.8B to $200.4B line)
  * Pet nutraceuticals component
  * Livestock additives component
  * What you are calling the “animal nutraceutical” headline number
* [ ] Align the time horizon. Title says (2024–2030) but several projections cite 2034/2035. Pick one:

  * Either change title to 2024–2035
  * Or keep title 2024–2030 and move 2034/2035 numbers into an appendix or “long-dated upside” callout

### 1.2 Remove production artifacts (these will instantly signal “WIP” to readers)

There are clear “conversion artifacts” and placeholders that the data centres paper does not have:

* Markdown header remnants like “## …” embedded mid-paragraph in the TAM/SAM/SOM area.
* “.news.” “.investor.” “.finance.” “.annualreport.” “.tradingview.” suffixes in references.
* Stray “petfoodindustry” tokens attached to company descriptions.
* A few copy glitches like missing spacing after punctuation and unmatched quotation marks.

**To do**

* [ ] Search the full doc for and eliminate: `##`, `###`, `####`, `.news`, `.investor`, `.finance`, `.annualreport`, `.tradingview`, `petfoodindustry`, and any `+2`, `+3` style citation residue (example: “marketreportanalytics+3”).
* [ ] Convert any markdown-style “headings” to true Word headings (Heading 1/2/3/4) so your TOC and PDF bookmarks work.
* [ ] Run a hard copy-edit pass specifically for:

  * Spacing after punctuation
  * Quote pairing
  * Consistent capitalization of defined terms
  * Consistent use of USD/EUR and “bn/mn” style

### 1.3 Complete all placeholder figures and standardize figure system

Right now several figures read like instructions rather than finished exhibits (for example, “Figure 21: Pharma Integration Funnel … annotate … estimated CLV multiplier …” and then the section header breaks). Also some figures appear as captions without an accompanying embedded chart (example: “Figure I.1 …” directly under the regulatory comparison header).

The data centres paper is extremely consistent here: charts are present, captioned, and sourced (example figure sourcing format).

**To do**

* [ ] Create a “figure register” (Excel or table) listing every Figure referenced in the document with:

  * Figure number
  * Title
  * Purpose (what decision it supports)
  * Data inputs
  * Source(s)
  * Status: draft / final
  * Location in document
* [ ] Standardize figure numbering scheme:

  * Either use Roman by section (Figure I.1, II.3, III.7, IV.2)
  * Or use global sequential (Figure 1…N)
  * Then re-number all captions and references to match
* [ ] For every figure: add a one-line “Source:” line under the chart (even if it’s “Company filings; analyst estimates”). Match the style discipline of the data centres PDF.
* [ ] Convert “instructional captions” into:

  * Short caption (what the chart shows)
  * Put “data notes / assumptions / construction” in a footnote or appendix

### 1.4 Fix internal category consistency where pet vs livestock language blurs

One example to clean up because it reads like a mismatch:

* In “II.6. Performance, FCR, and Growth” you write it accounts for “16% of the total pet supplement market” even though the section is livestock-oriented (FCR).

**To do**

* [ ] Do a full pass tagging each Part II category as: Pet, Livestock, Both.
* [ ] Ensure each category’s market share statements reference the correct denominator (pet supplements vs feed additives vs total animal nutraceuticals).
* [ ] Add a small “taxonomy key” at the start of Part II that tells the reader which categories apply to which species and which channels.

---

## 2) Priority 1 checklist: add the “research white paper” features your data centres PDF nails

### 2.1 Add front matter that improves navigation and credibility

Your data centres PDF uses a strong front-matter stack: TOC with page numbers, then exec summary, then clean section openers. Also it ends with author and legal/distribution language.

**To do**

* [ ] Add a Table of Contents with:

  * Major sections and subsections
  * Page numbers
  * Optional: list of figures page
* [ ] Add “At a glance” page immediately after exec summary:

  * 5 headline metrics (TAM, growth, margin split, channel split, top catalysts)
  * 1 value chain diagram
  * 1 margin vs multiple scatter (pet vs livestock)
* [ ] Add “How to read this paper” box:

  * What’s new insight vs what’s background
  * Which sections are most relevant to which reader type (investor, strategist, operator)
* [ ] Add author/contact page and (if applicable for distribution) a disclaimer page similar in intent to the data centres paper’s closing section.

### 2.2 Make methodology explicit, not implicit

One of the strongest “research tells” in the data centres paper is the presence of original methodology like the capex tracker built from Bloomberg consensus across ~50 companies.

Your nutraceuticals paper will feel much more “institutional” if you make methodology legible in the same way, especially because you use many market size estimates and forward projections (TAM/SAM/SOM).

**To do**

* [ ] Add a “Methodology” box (early Part III or appendix) covering:

  * Market sizing approach (top-down triangulation vs bottom-up from company revenues)
  * CAGR calculation method and base year conventions
  * Currency conversion conventions (FX date, constant vs current)
  * What counts as “nutraceutical revenue” in company reporting (especially when bundled)
* [ ] Create at least one “original tracker” akin to the data centres tracker:

  * Option A: “Public comps tracker” for 25–40 companies across the value chain with revenue, EBITDA margin, valuation multiple, and segment exposure
  * Option B: “M&A / funding tracker” since 2020 with deal size, buyer type, rationale
  * Option C: “Regulatory timeline tracker” by region with key milestones and enforcement dates
* [ ] Where you cite margin and multiple ranges (for example, pet brands at 20–25% and mid-teens to 20x+), back them with:

  * A comps table
  * A summary distribution chart (median, quartiles)

### 2.3 Add “section opener” pages with thesis statements

Your data centres paper uses clear section openers with a short framing paragraph (example: “SECTION 1” with a tight summary). That structure makes a long paper feel navigable.

**To do**

* [ ] For each major part (I, II, III, IV), add a 1-page opener:

  * 3–5 key claims that part will prove
  * 1 anchor exhibit
  * “So what” for investors and strategists
* [ ] Ensure each part ends with a “Key takeaways” mini-panel:

  * 5 bullets maximum
  * 1 implication line

---

## 3) Priority 2 checklist: make the content tighter, more investable, and easier to trust

### 3.1 Turn “Investment Themes” into an explicit investable framework

You already have “Investment Themes” in the Key Findings section and a banking/investment implications section with a strong “two-speed market” framing.

To match the data centres paper’s “framework” feel, you want to make the investable framework more mechanical and repeatable.

**To do**

* [ ] Create a 2x2 “Where to play / how to win” matrix:

  * X-axis: clinical proof + regulatory defensibility
  * Y-axis: channel control + brand power
  * Plot representative players and label “winners” archetypes
* [ ] Add a “watchlist” table (public + private) with:

  * Ticker (if public)
  * Segment exposure (pet vs livestock)
  * Moat type (clinical, manufacturing, channel, brand)
  * Near-term catalysts (regulatory, launches, M&A)
  * Key risks
* [ ] Add a “what changes our mind” section:

  * 5 items maximum
  * Each mapped to a measurable indicator

### 3.2 Strengthen the regulatory section with decision-useful artifacts

Part I is already a solid base, with a concrete description of US regulatory friction and evolving pathways.

**To do**

* [ ] Replace “Figure I.1” placeholder with an actual side-by-side table that includes:

  * Claims permitted
  * Evidence standard
  * Approval pathway and typical timeline
  * Enforcement body
  * Labeling constraints
* [ ] Add a “claims ladder” graphic:

  * Nutritional support claim
  * Structure/function claim
  * Therapeutic claim
  * The regulatory tripwire points that shift classification into drug territory
* [ ] Add an “approval timeline economics” chart:

  * Cost and time ranges for each pathway
  * Implication: who can afford compliance and who cannot
* [ ] Add a “regulatory catalyst calendar” (US, EU, UK, Asia) with the specific reforms you mention and what “de-risking” means in practice.

### 3.3 Tighten Part II with consistent mini-templates for each functional segment

Part II is content-rich, but it will feel more institutional if every segment reads with the same internal architecture.

**To do**

* [ ] Standardize each Part II segment into a fixed template:

  1. Category definition and target species
  2. Core ingredients and mechanisms
  3. Evidence quality (high/medium/low) with 1–2 citations
  4. Price architecture (premium vs mass)
  5. Channel mix (vet, retail, e-com, subscription)
  6. Key players
  7. Market size and growth (with source)
  8. Key risks and regulatory notes
* [ ] Fix copy inconsistencies and punctuation issues (example spacing/quote artifacts in the behavioral section).
* [ ] Add “evidence grading” that prevents over-claiming:

  * For each ingredient group, tag the strength of evidence, and keep claims aligned with the tag

### 3.4 Make the competitive landscape section feel like a true “map,” not just a list

You already have strong raw material, including a multi-layer value chain description and the idea of capital flows targeting certain layers plus a competitive mapping table start.

**To do**

* [ ] Turn the value chain into a single “industry map” exhibit:

  * Upstream inputs
  * Biofermentation and actives
  * Formulation and manufacturing
  * Brands
  * Channels and data gatekeepers
  * Overlay: typical gross margin and EBITDA margin by layer
* [ ] For each player bucket (pharma, feed majors, brands, gatekeepers), add:

  * 2–3 “strategic moves” (recent M&A, product launches, channel shifts)
  * What it implies for new entrants
* [ ] Clean and upgrade the references feeding these claims (remove suffix artifacts like “.annualreport.dsm-firmenich” and “petfoodindustry”).

---

## 4) Figure-by-figure completion tasks

This is the fastest way to “feel final”: turn every placeholder into a finished exhibit, standardize captioning, and add sources.

Here are high-impact examples pulled from the current draft:

### 4.1 Regulatory and scope figures

* [ ] **Figure I.1 (US vs EU comparison)**: build the actual comparison table or infographic (currently referenced as a caption line).
* [ ] Add a “regulatory pathway flowchart” for US (FDA-CVM, AFIC, SRIS, state adoption) reflecting the narrative you already wrote.

### 4.2 Consumer behavior and willingness-to-pay figures

* [ ] **Figure 13 (Share of owners vs share of revenue)**: build the two-pie exhibit and add the missing source line (you have “Sources:” but it’s not populated with the relevant data source).
* [ ] **Figure III.11.B (Psychological drivers)**: build the chart and separate the narrative that currently runs into the figure spec.

### 4.3 Product mix and premiumization figures

* [ ] **Figure 15 (Premiumization shift)**: build the stacked area chart and add source and assumptions, plus a short caption stating the point it proves.

### 4.4 Strategy/value chain figures

* [ ] **Figure 21 (Pharma integration funnel)**: build the funnel diagram, remove the embedded markdown artifact that follows it, and add a clean transition into the Market Synthesis section.
* [ ] Replace raw “Sources:” URL lines with footnotes and formal references.

### 4.5 Global figure standards (apply to all exhibits)

* [ ] Every figure gets:

  * Consistent number format
  * Clear title that states the conclusion (not just the topic)
  * One-line “Source:” line
  * Footnote for assumptions if needed
* [ ] Every figure is referenced in the body at least once with: “(Figure X)”
* [ ] Add a “List of Figures” page (optional but very professional)

---

## 5) References and sourcing: upgrade to “institutional grade”

Right now the references are a mix of high-quality sources (OECD-FAO, Eurostat, USDA, annual reports) and lower-quality web sources, and they include formatting artifacts like “.news.” and “.finance.” suffixes.

**To do**

* [ ] Choose a citation system and apply it consistently:

  * Option A: Footnotes per page (common in research PDFs)
  * Option B: Endnotes + bibliography
* [ ] Create a “source quality hierarchy”:

  * Tier 1: regulators, official statistics (FDA, EFSA, USDA, Eurostat), audited filings
  * Tier 2: reputable industry research (Bain, LEK), peer-reviewed papers
  * Tier 3: market research aggregators (use sparingly and triangulate)
  * Tier 4: blogs/PR (avoid as primary sources)
* [ ] For every headline numeric claim in Exec Summary and Key Findings (market sizes, shares, % control, margin ranges), add:

  * A footnote reference
  * Or a supporting exhibit
* [ ] Remove all suffix artifacts (`.news`, `.investor`, etc.) and replace with proper bibliographic fields:

  * Publisher
  * Title
  * Date
  * URL (optional in print, can be omitted if footnoted)
  * Access date (if web)
* [ ] Where you use “internal industry analysis” phrasing, separate it into:

  * “Analyst estimates” vs “company disclosures” vs “third party”

---

## 6) Structural and formatting parity with the data centres PDF

### 6.1 Create a TOC and PDF-like navigation

Your benchmark has a clean TOC and section structure.

**To do**

* [ ] Ensure every heading uses Word heading styles (Heading 1/2/3/4), not manual formatting
* [ ] Insert an auto-generated TOC and lock it before PDF export
* [ ] Add headers/footers:

  * Document title (short)
  * Section name (optional)
  * Page numbers

### 6.2 Create “section openers” with consistent design language

Data centres has clear “SECTION 1” type openers that reset the reader.

**To do**

* [ ] Add full-page section openers for Parts I–IV:

  * A single hero image or hero chart
  * 4–6 bullet “what we will show”
  * 1 paragraph “so what”

### 6.3 Add end matter (author + disclaimer) appropriate to your distribution

Data centres ends with author and legal disclaimer sections.

**To do**

* [ ] Add an author/contact page (even if it’s just one author)
* [ ] Add distribution/disclaimer language appropriate to your use case (client handout vs public download vs internal)
* [ ] Add a “data limitations” note (important for market research aggregator reliance)

---

## 7) Section-by-section punch list (exhaustive)

### Executive Summary and Key Findings

**Goal:** make it instantly “decision useful” and cleanly sourced.

* [ ] Add an “At a glance” metric strip and 2 key exhibits
* [ ] Add citations for each bullet claim (market sizes, multiples, top 5 share, regional shares)
* [ ] Tighten the headline TAM statement so it matches Part III TAM/SAM/SOM language

### Part I: Definition, scope, regulatory

**Goal:** convert narrative into tools (tables/flowcharts) and reduce ambiguity.

* [ ] Fix quotation mark issue in the “grey area between pharmaceuticals and food” sentence (missing closing quote)
* [ ] Replace Figure I.1 placeholder with an actual exhibit
* [ ] Add a one-page “claims ladder” and “pathway timeline” (US, EU)

### Part II: Functional segmentation

**Goal:** make it scannable, comparable, and evidence-graded.

* [ ] Standardize every segment template (definition, ingredients, evidence, market size, channels, players, risks)
* [ ] Correct pet vs livestock denominator mistakes (example in II.6)
* [ ] Fix copy/punctuation issues in II.5 behavioral wellness
* [ ] Add 1 summary table at the end of Part II:

  * Rows: segments
  * Columns: species applicability, growth, margin profile, evidence strength, channel dominance

### Part III: Market structure, regional dynamics, TAM/SAM/SOM

**Goal:** make market sizing defensible and unify time horizon.

* [ ] Remove markdown artifact that breaks flow from Figure 21 into III.6
* [ ] Replace raw “Sources:” URL line with formal citation and add at least one exhibit supporting the TAM math
* [ ] Create a “TAM bridge” figure that visually reconciles:

  * Pet nutraceuticals
  * Livestock additives
  * Total “animal nutraceuticals” headline
* [ ] Add scenarios (base/bull/bear) similar in spirit to how the data centres paper uses structured scenario framing for key debates

### Part IV: Competitive landscape and banking implications

**Goal:** turn it into a map + investable screen.

* [ ] Clean the player descriptions to remove token artifacts like “petfoodindustry”.
* [ ] Fix references formatting and remove “.news.” / “.annualreport.” suffixes.
* [ ] Expand the “Comprehensive Competitive Mapping Table” to include:

  * % revenue exposure to nutraceuticals (where knowable)
  * Channel exposure
  * Recent M&A actions
  * R&D intensity proxy
* [ ] Build a “margin vs multiple” scatter derived from the claims you already make (pet vs livestock premium)
* [ ] Add a 1-page “Implications” close: top 5 investable conclusions + top 5 diligence questions

---

## 8) Final polish pass to match the data centres “feel”

These are the things that make the finished PDF read like a designed research product.

**To do**

* [ ] Create a consistent visual system:

  * Fonts
  * Heading hierarchy
  * Callout box style
  * Figure styling (axes, labels, footnotes)
* [ ] Ensure every page has intentional whitespace and no orphan headings
* [ ] Ensure consistent terminology:

  * “nutraceuticals” vs “supplements” vs “feed additives”
  * “companion animals” vs “pets”
  * “premix” vs “compound feed”
* [ ] Standardize number formatting:

  * $ vs USD
  * bn/mn
  * consistent year labeling (CY/FY)
* [ ] Export to PDF with:

  * Bookmarks from headings
  * Embedded fonts
  * High-res figures

---

## 9) A simple “definition of done” so you know you’ve hit the benchmark

Use this as your final gate before you call it finished:

* [ ] TOC works and matches headings
* [ ] No markdown artifacts or broken reference tags remain
* [ ] Every figure exists, is referenced in text, and has a Source line (benchmark behavior)
* [ ] All headline numbers in the exec summary have citations
* [ ] Market size story is coherent across cover, exec, and TAM/SAM/SOM
* [ ] End matter exists (author/contact; disclaimer appropriate to distribution), mirroring the professionalism of the benchmark

If you want, I can also convert this to a working checklist you can paste into Notion/Trello (same items, but structured as tasks with sub-tasks and acceptance criteria).
