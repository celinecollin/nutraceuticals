**Cow mastitis in dairy and beef cattle**

*Focus: what it is, how common it is, market and finance, and which
nutraceuticals are actually used and sold*

**1) What mastitis is**

Mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland (udder), most often caused
by bacteria that enter through the teat canal. It occurs as:

- **Clinical mastitis**: visible abnormal milk (clots, watery milk,
  color change) plus udder swelling, heat, pain, and sometimes systemic
  illness.

- **Subclinical mastitis**: no obvious milk or udder changes, but
  **elevated somatic cell count (SCC)** and reduced milk yield/quality.

**Can "beef" cattle have mastitis?**

Yes. **Beef cows can get mastitis** (clinical, subclinical, and "summer
mastitis"). It is often under-detected because beef cows are not
routinely milked, so subclinical cases show up indirectly (calf growth,
udder palpation, or "blind quarters").

**2) How common is mastitis?**

**Dairy cattle (global)**

A large systematic review and meta-analysis reported global prevalence
estimates of about:

- **Subclinical mastitis (SCM): 42%**

- **Clinical mastitis (CM): 15%**

These are pooled global estimates across many studies and settings, so
real-world numbers vary widely by region, herd management, pathogens,
genetics, and detection intensity.

**Beef cows (examples from published studies)**

In a Swedish beef-cow study (udder-quarter sampling), approximately:

- **50%** of cows had **subclinical mastitis** in at least one quarter

- **40%** had **intramammary infection (IMI)**

- **10%** had at least one **blind quarter**

Economic relevance in beef herds is real: one classic study found calves
nursing **Staphylococcus aureus-infected dams** had **205-day adjusted
weight gain about 9.6 kg lower** than calves of uninfected dams.

**"Summer mastitis" (often relevant to beef and grazing systems)**

Summer mastitis is typically an aggressive udder infection in **dry cows
and heifers** during fly season, commonly linked to **Trueperella
pyogenes** and fly transmission. It can also occur in youngstock of both
sexes in rudimentary udders in some cases.

**3) Finance: why mastitis matters economically**

**Global burden (dairy industry level)**

A 2024 analysis estimating global losses from major dairy cattle
diseases reported:

- **Total annual global losses \~US\$65B** (across modeled diseases)

- **Clinical mastitis \~US\$13B** and **subclinical mastitis \~US\$9B**
  as among the costliest disease categories.

**Per-case cost (farm economics)**

Different studies use different assumptions, but several widely cited
estimates include:

- **\$444 per case** of clinical mastitis in the **first 30 days of
  lactation**, split into direct and indirect costs in a modeling study.

- A 2024 modeling paper estimated average costs around:

  - **\$170 per true-positive IMI case** in early lactation

  - **\$521 per clinical mastitis case** (with ranges depending on
    parity, etiology, stage).

**"Control plan economics" (what prevention is worth)**

A 2025 Uruguay study modeling farm-level mastitis economics reported
mean:

- **Failure costs (Fc): 294 US\$/cow/year**

- **Prevention costs (Pc): 47 US\$/cow/year**

- **Total costs (Tc): 341 US\$/cow/year**\
  ...and concluded that improving udder health plans was cost-effective
  in most farms modeled.

**4) Market size and where nutraceuticals fit**

There are two closely related market lenses:

1.  **"Bovine mastitis market"** (often therapeutics + diagnostics;
    definitions vary by publisher)

2.  **"Udder health market"** (broader, often including prevention
    products, hygiene, diagnostics, sometimes equipment)

**Current market size estimates (range, because definitions differ)**

**Where nutraceuticals sit**

There is rarely a cleanly reported "mastitis nutraceuticals" market
number. In practice, nutraceuticals for mastitis are usually counted
inside broader categories such as:

- **Animal feed additives** (vitamins, trace minerals, probiotics,
  phytogenics)

- **On-farm boluses and supplements** (often sold as nutritional support
  for udder health)

For context, the **global animal feed additives market** is estimated
around **US\$25B (2024)** with growth projected to **US\$38.2B
(2034)**.\
This matters financially because "udder health supplements" are a small
niche inside a very large feed-additive distribution ecosystem.

**5) Which nutraceuticals are actually used for mastitis?**

Important framing: **nutraceuticals are mainly used for prevention, risk
reduction, or support**, not as a substitute for evidence-based
veterinary treatment of severe clinical mastitis. Mainstream clinical
treatment still relies on pathogen-informed antimicrobials,
anti-inflammatories, fluids/electrolytes in severe cases, and management
changes.

**What farms commonly give (real-world patterns)**

Across dairy (and sometimes beef breeding herds), nutraceutical use
clusters around high-risk windows:

- **Transition period** (roughly 3 weeks pre-calving to 3 weeks
  post-calving)

- **Dry-off and close-up** (for dairy)

- **Fly season for grazing/dry cattle** (summer mastitis risk management
  is mostly non-nutraceutical)

Common nutraceutical categories:

1.  **Trace minerals** (selenium, zinc, copper, iodine, cobalt,
    manganese) via premixes or slow-release boluses

2.  **Vitamins/antioxidants** (notably vitamin E) as part of
    transition-cow programs

3.  **Probiotics and yeast-derived products** aimed at immune modulation
    and inflammation control

4.  **Phytogenics** (garlic, essential oils, herbal blends) often sold
    as "udder health boluses"

5.  **Immune-support feed additives** with branded claims (example
    below)

**6) Nutraceutical products marketed for udder health or mastitis**

Below is a practical list of nutraceuticals that are sold specifically
into the "udder health" or "mastitis support" space, with an
evidence-based "clinical relevancy" assessment.

**Evidence labels used here**

- **Higher**: at least one controlled cow study with meaningful
  udder-health endpoints (IMI prevalence, SCC, mastitis incidence), and
  plausible mechanism.

- **Moderate**: some controlled data but limited replication, or
  outcomes mainly surrogate (SCC, biomarkers).

- **Low**: limited independent cow mastitis data; mostly mechanistic
  rationale, small studies, or marketing claims.

- **Unclear**: insufficient independent data located in accessible
  sources.

**A notable "garlic extract bolus" study (not necessarily a branded
commercial product)**

A 2023 paper describes treating subclinical mastitis cows with a single
**orally administered garlic extract bolus** (90 g bolus composition
described in the paper) alongside meloxicam, and compares sensor-based
biomarkers with an antibiotic + NSAID group.\
This is relevant because it shows garlic-bolus treatment is being
formally studied, but it should be treated as **emerging evidence**
until replicated and clearly linked to robust cure or recurrence
outcomes.

**7) Practical takeaways on "what nutraceuticals are given"**

**If you look across farms, the nutraceutical playbook usually
becomes:**

1.  **Base nutrition right first** (energy balance, trace minerals,
    vitamins)

2.  Add **targeted immune-support feed additives** during transition or
    known high-SCC periods

3.  Use **boluses with botanicals or essential oils** mainly when
    farmers want an antibiotic-sparing option, especially in organic or
    low-antibiotic programs

4.  For **summer mastitis**, focus spending on **fly control and grazing
    management**, not nutraceuticals

**"Clinical relevancy" reality check**

- The best-supported interventions for mastitis outcomes are still
  **management + hygiene + diagnostics + appropriate therapeutics**.

- Nutraceuticals can be financially attractive when they measurably
  reduce SCC penalties, reduce clinical case incidence, or improve
  early-lactation robustness, but the evidence base is uneven across
  products.

**8) The finance of the nutraceutical side**

**Why companies like nutraceutical positioning**

- Lower regulatory burden than pharmaceuticals in many jurisdictions
  (depends on claims and route)

- Sold through established feed and farm-supply channels

- Can be positioned around big economic levers: SCC premiums/penalties,
  milk discard, culling risk, labor

**What you can measure to evaluate ROI on-farm**

- Bulk tank SCC trend and percent high-SCC cows

- Clinical mastitis incidence per 100 cow-months

- First-30-DIM mastitis incidence

- Milk yield recovery curves after cases (loss distribution is wide;
  some studies quantify milk losses from treated cases)

- Total mastitis cost per cow-year (failure costs vs prevention costs
  framework)

**Public market exposure**

One example of a public company with a branded immune-support feed
additive used in dairy systems is **Phibro Animal Health (NYSE: PAHC)**
(OmniGen-AF is associated with Phibro in the peer-reviewed trial author
affiliations).

Other public names with exposure to cattle health, udder health
products, or diagnostic ecosystems include Zoetis (ZTS), Elanco (ELAN),
and IDEXX (IDXX). (This is not investment advice, just a mapping of
where public-market exposure exists.)
