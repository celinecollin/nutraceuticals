**1. Executive summary**

**The core shift**

Animal nutraceuticals and functional feed products are moving from
"marketing-claims-first" to "authorization-first." This is driven by:

- tighter enforcement against drug claims (especially online marketing
  and testimonials),

- growing demand for measurable outcomes (food safety, performance,
  environment),

- and the rise of novel modalities (microbiome, phage, enzymes, methane
  inhibitors) that do not fit legacy "nutrition only" buckets.

A clear signal is the FDA approval pathway being used by products
historically positioned as "supplements," plus the expansion of feed
additive approvals for explicit environmental outcomes (methane,
ammonia).

**The practical implication**

If you are building, investing in, or acquiring an animal nutraceutical
company, you need to decide early:

- Are we a commodity ingredient with limited claims and limited pricing
  power?

- Or are we building a regulated, claim-backed product with defensible
  differentiation (data, authorization, exclusivity, distribution
  restrictions, and quality systems)?

Trying to sit in the middle often creates the worst risk profile:
drug-claim exposure without the protection of approval.

**The "missing middle" is evolving in the US**

Historically, FDA CVM treated many structure/function or production
claims in animal food as drug claims. In May 2024, FDA withdrew the old
internal policy manual (PPM 1240.3605) and has been signaling new
guidance and a possible new pathway for "zootechnical substances."

Congress has repeatedly introduced the Innovative FEED Act concept to
create "zootechnical animal food substances" as a food additive
category. As of January 2026:

- H.R. 2203 (introduced March 18, 2025) is still in "Introduced" status.

- S. 1906 (introduced May 22, 2025) is still in "Introduced" status.

**Why the Multimin 90 precedent matters (and what it does not mean)**

Multimin 90 is FDA-approved as a new animal drug with a defined
indication: "to provide a supplemental source of zinc, copper,
manganese, and selenium in cattle," plus significant labeling
restrictions (pregnancy first trimester restriction, age restrictions)
and a withdrawal period.

This is powerful commercially (regulated status, labeling clarity,
quality expectations, potential exclusivity and patent positioning), but
it does not automatically permit broad "immune optimization" or
"reproductive efficiency" promotional claims unless they are supported
and included within approved labeling or are otherwise compliant
communications. The moat is the approval and its legal boundaries, not
marketing creativity.

**2. What "pharmaceuticalization" means in animal nutrition and why it
is accelerating**

**Working definition**

"Pharmaceuticalization" in animal nutraceuticals is the shift from:

- broad, loosely substantiated wellness claims and commodity-like
  selling\
  to

- products that look and behave more like regulated animal health
  interventions: defined indication, validated outcomes, controlled
  dosing, quality-controlled manufacturing, and increasingly formal
  premarket authorization.

**Why now**

1.  **Enforcement risk has moved to the front office**\
    Online claims (your site, distributor pages, reseller listings,
    social posts, PDFs, testimonials, "protocol charts," and even
    customer service scripts) create "intended use." FDA enforcement
    letters show that "we are not FDA approved so we cannot make claims"
    does not immunize you if your marketing still communicates disease
    treatment or structure/function drug intent.

2.  **Outcome-driven value creation**\
    Environmental claims and food safety claims (methane reduction,
    ammonia reduction, pathogen reduction) are increasingly monetizable
    through procurement standards, carbon programs, and retailer
    pressure, but they require measurable endpoints that regulators can
    evaluate.

3.  **Novel modalities do not map cleanly to "nutrition"**\
    Microbiome modulators, bacteriophages, and methane inhibitors are
    functional by design. Jurisdictions that provide an explicit feed
    additive authorization channel (EU) are ahead, and the US is trying
    to define clearer routes.

**3. Definitions: nutraceutical vs animal food vs feed additive vs
veterinary drug vs biologic**

**A. Animal nutraceutical (industry term)**

Not a universally consistent legal category. Often means:

- supplements, functional feed ingredients, additives, and wellness
  products positioned between "feed" and "drug."

**B. Animal food / feed (legal concept in many jurisdictions)**

Generally: products intended to provide nutrition. Claims must remain
within what the jurisdiction considers permissible for food.

**C. Feed additive (EU formal concept; US concept via food additive
approval)**

A substance added to animal feed to achieve a function (on the feed, the
animal, the environment, or the resulting food product), often requiring
premarket authorization depending on the jurisdiction.

**D. Veterinary drug / new animal drug (US)**

Products intended for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or
prevention of disease, and also products intended to affect structure or
function of the body (depending on intended use and regulatory
interpretation). FDA warning letters illustrate this in practice.

**E. Veterinary biologic (US)**

Typically under USDA APHIS Center for Veterinary Biologics (vaccines,
certain immunological products). This matters when a "nutraceutical"
starts to look like an immune-modulating biologic.

**4. How regulators decide classification (the "intended use engine")**

**The single most important rule**

**Classification follows intended use, and intended use is inferred from
your total communications and product context.**

Sources of intended use include:

- label claims and directions,

- website claims and blog content,

- distributor and reseller copy,

- testimonials and reviews you highlight,

- "protocol posters" and comparison charts,

- social media posts and influencer campaigns,

- technical sheets and "whitepapers" used for selling,

- and even your customer support scripts.

A cautionary example: the FDA warning letter to Synergy Animal Products
describes how disease and structure/function claims on a website and
labeling drove the "unapproved new animal drug" conclusion, and the
firm's attempt to disclaim FDA approval did not prevent enforcement.

**Practical takeaway**

Compliance is not a label exercise. It is a cross-functional system:

- claim governance,

- content review process,

- channel partner controls,

- and documentation (substantiation files, version control).

**5. United States: today's reality plus what is changing (2024 to
2026)**

**5.1 The US "lane structure" (simplified)**

You generally operate in one of these lanes:

1.  **Animal food ingredient lane**

- Typically relies on GRAS (self or notification), AAFCO ingredient
  definitions (state acceptance), or food additive approvals depending
  on the ingredient and intended use.

- Many claims are constrained. "Structure/function" style claims have
  been a key friction point.

2.  **Food additive approval lane**

- For additives not GRAS and not otherwise lawful.

- Emerging focus: substances acting in the gut with effects related to
  digestion byproducts, microbiome, foodborne pathogens, or
  environmental outcomes (this is exactly what the Innovative FEED Act
  proposals try to formalize).

3.  **New animal drug lane (NADA, conditional approval, indexing in
    limited cases)**

- Highest regulatory burden and highest moat potential.

- Enables defined indications and stronger commercialization
  defensibility if executed well.

**5.2 Key US changes you must account for**

**A. Withdrawal of PPM 1240.3605 (May 2024)**

FDA withdrew CVM's old manual on regulating animal foods with drug
claims because it no longer reflected current thinking.

This matters because many companies (and investors) relied on the old
policy assumptions. The post-withdrawal period is transitional and
policy is still evolving.

**B. FDA is actively encouraging early engagement on "novel animal foods
with drug claims"**

FDA's May 2024 "letter to industry" encourages firms developing
gut-acting substances with claims related to production, wellbeing, food
safety, and environmental benefits to contact the agency early.

**C. Draft guidance under development: zootechnical substances and
structure/function animal food**

FDA's list of guidances under development includes:

- Draft GFI #289: Use of Zootechnical Substances in Animal Food

- Draft GFI #291: Animal Food Intended to Affect the Structure or
  Function of the Animal

Even before final publication, their existence is a major signal for
strategic planning.

**D. FDA's enforcement posture on AAFCO-defined ingredients (GFI 293,
Oct 2024)**

CVM GFI #293 states FDA generally does not intend to initiate
enforcement action for food additive approval requirements for
ingredients listed in the AAFCO 2024 Official Publication chapter six,
under specified conditions.

This is not "approval," but it is a real compliance lever for companies
using ingredients within that scope.

**5.3 Legislative watch: Innovative FEED Act (not enacted as of Jan
2026)**

The Innovative FEED Act concept aims to create a defined pathway for
"zootechnical animal food substances" as food additives (not animal
drugs), focusing on substances that act solely within the GI tract and
intended to:

- affect digestive byproducts,

- reduce foodborne pathogens of human health significance,

- or alter the GI microbiome.

As of January 2026, both 2025 versions are still introduced (not
passed).

**6. European Union: feed additive authorizations and zootechnical
claims**

**6.1 The EU's key advantage: an explicit feed additive authorization
system**

Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 defines feed additive categories, including
zootechnical additives (additives used to affect favorably performance
of animals in good health or affect favorably the environment).

This is not a loophole. It is a formal system with:

- defined functional groups,

- premarket evaluation and authorization,

- conditions of use and labeling,

- and, in some cases, post-market monitoring requirements.

**6.2 Example: methane reduction as a zootechnical environmental claim
(3-NOP)**

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/565 authorizes
3-nitrooxypropanol as a feed additive for dairy cows and cows for
reproduction, classified as:

- category: zootechnical additives

- functional group: substances which favorably affect the environment\
  and recognizes the potential to reduce enteric methane production.

**7. UK, Canada, and other major markets: practical notes**

**UK**

The UK often mirrors EU-style frameworks for feed additive authorization
concepts and has publicly addressed Bovaer approvals and misinformation
dynamics.

**Canada**

Public UK materials note Bovaer authorization in Canada (January 2024)
and in the US (May 2024). Use this as a signal to verify the exact
Canadian pathway for your product class early in planning.

**Practical point for multi-market launches**

Do not assume you can "port" a US claims set into the EU or vice versa.
The EU often allows explicit zootechnical claims under authorization,
while the US historically forced similar claims toward drug
classification (and is now evolving policy).

**8. Case study 1: Multimin 90 and what it proves**

**8.1 What Multimin 90 is (regulatory facts)**

FDA approval details (primary sources):

- NADA 141-582, approval date April 26, 2024, Rx status.

- Indication: "To provide a supplemental source of zinc, copper,
  manganese, and selenium in cattle."

- Key restrictions include: not for use in pregnant cows/heifers during
  first trimester, and restrictions in young calves (safety not
  established).

- FDA FOI summary describes safety, effectiveness rationale, and human
  food safety evaluation, including a withdrawal period of 14 days and
  milk discard time of 0 days.

- Green Book update lists exclusivity (5 years) and patents with listed
  expirations in 2029.

Axiota's public communication frames the business transition: moving a
historically marketed product through the FDA drug approval process and
emphasizing the completion of transition to FDA-approved labeling.

**8.2 What this case study means for "pharmaceuticalization"**

Multimin 90 demonstrates a path where:

- a nutrition-adjacent product category can be commercialized with
  drug-like regulatory rigor,

- enabling a clearer compliance posture and a differentiated market
  position (Rx distribution, defined indication, stronger quality
  expectations).

**8.3 What it does not mean (critical corrections)**

- The approved indication is a supplemental source of trace minerals. It
  is not a blanket approval for broad wellness or disease-adjacent
  claims (immune optimization, reproductive efficiency) unless those
  claims are supported, appropriately framed, and compliant with
  applicable promotional rules.

**8.4 Investor-grade lessons from Multimin 90**

1.  **Regulatory work can convert "trust" into enforceable
    differentiation**\
    Approval anchors what can be said and how it is distributed.

2.  **Quality systems become part of the moat**\
    FOI summaries often highlight safety, residue work, and
    manufacturing controls that commodity products lack.

3.  **Labeling restrictions matter commercially**\
    Restrictions and withdrawal times change adoption patterns and
    channel strategies.

**9. Case study 2: environmental claims as the catalyst (Experior and
Bovaer)**

**9.1 Experior (lubabegron): FDA-approved drug claim tied to ammonia
emissions**

DailyMed labeling lists an indication for reduction of ammonia gas
emissions per pound of live weight and hot carcass weight in beef steers
and heifers during the last 14 to 91 days on feed, and notes
effectiveness not demonstrated for less than 14 days.

This illustrates a key point:

- environmental claims can be regulated with drug-like rigor when the
  claim is specific and measurable.

**9.2 Bovaer (3-NOP): methane reduction with regulatory approvals**

- EU: authorized via Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/565 as
  a zootechnical additive (environment functional group), with
  EFSA-based conclusions referenced in the regulation.

- US: Reuters reported FDA approval for Elanco's Bovaer as a feed
  ingredient to reduce methane emissions in lactating dairy cows (May
  2024).

- DSM-firmenich stated FDA completed its review and determined safety
  and efficacy requirements were met for lactating dairy cattle, paving
  the way for market launch with partner Elanco.

**9.3 What this means for 2025 to 2030**

Environmental outcomes are a new "authorization wedge":

- They create measurable endpoints regulators can evaluate.

- They create monetization paths (procurement, carbon programs,
  sustainability reporting).

- They raise the bar for evidence and post-market defensibility.

**10. Case study 3: bacteriophages as authorized zootechnical additives
(EU Bafasal)**

**10.1 The early science and regulatory problem**

Earlier EFSA-related documentation (available via PubMed Central) shows
the FEEDAP panel concluded Bafasal was safe for target species,
consumers, and environment, but initially could not conclude efficacy
due to insufficient data.

This captures a recurring pattern for novel modalities:

- safety can be established earlier than efficacy for a specific claim.

- "efficacy for claim X" is the gating item.

**10.2 The authorization milestone (July 2025)**

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1390 authorizes a
preparation of specific bacteriophages as a feed additive for poultry,
classified as:

- category: zootechnical additives

- functional group: other zootechnical additives\
  and it references EFSA opinions including conclusions about potential
  to reduce environmental contamination with Salmonella Enteritidis
  under specified uses.

It also explicitly notes a need for specific post-market monitoring to
address potential selection and spread of resistant variants.

**10.3 Why this matters**

This is a concrete example that:

- phage-based interventions can achieve formal authorization,

- but may carry post-market monitoring obligations that you must
  operationalize.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**11.2 "Red flag" claim words that frequently trigger drug
classification**

- treat, prevent, cure, mitigate

- anti-inflammatory, antibacterial (when framed as therapeutic for
  disease)

- "for mastitis," "for scours," "for respiratory disease," etc

- dosing protocols tied to diseases

The Synergy Animal Products warning letter provides concrete examples of
claims FDA viewed as establishing drug intent, including references to
mastitis, scours, and high somatic cell count.

**11.3 Safer alternative phrasing (not a guarantee)**

If you want to stay in an animal food lane, favor:

- nutritional role language,

- normal function support language,

- and avoid disease endpoints.

But do not assume "supports" is a magic shield. Classification still
depends on context, substantiation, and overall messaging.

**12. Evidence and dossier strategy by pathway**

**12.1 US animal food ingredient strategy (GRAS / AAFCO / enforcement
discretion)**

Core components investors expect to see:

- identity and specifications (what is it, how is it made, what is in
  it),

- safety basis (target species safety, contaminants, margins of
  exposure),

- manufacturing controls and supplier qualification,

- intended use statement that aligns with lawful claims,

- substantiation file for every marketing statement.

Operational lever: if your ingredient is in AAFCO 2024 chapter six,
understand the scope of FDA's enforcement policy described in CVM GFI
293.

**12.2 US food additive strategy (including proposed "zootechnical
substances" direction)**

Plan around:

- early FDA engagement (premarket consult),

- clear mechanism and site of action (gut-only vs systemic),

- measurable endpoints and study designs,

- and conservative claim governance until policy is finalized.

FDA explicitly encourages early contact for novel animal foods with
gut-only action and substantiated claims related to production,
wellbeing, food safety, and environmental benefits.

**12.3 US new animal drug strategy (NADA)**

Expect to build:

- Safety package: target animal safety; user safety; human food safety
  (residues) for food animals; environmental assessment.

- Effectiveness package: "substantial evidence" with appropriate study
  design, endpoints, and controls.

- CMC: drug substance and drug product controls, stability, batch
  consistency, release testing.

- Labeling: exact indication wording, warnings, restrictions, withdrawal
  times.

Multimin 90's FOI summary shows the breadth of considerations FDA
evaluated, including overdose toxicity concerns and human food safety
risk characterization.

**12.4 EU feed additive authorization strategy**

A typical EFSA-aligned dossier includes:

- characterization and manufacturing process,

- safety for target species, consumers, users, environment,

- efficacy for the proposed functional group,

- stability and homogeneity,

- analytical methods and reference lab considerations.

EU implementing regulations (3-NOP and phages) show how authorizations
explicitly encode functional groups, use conditions, and sometimes
post-market monitoring.

**13. Manufacturing, quality, and supply chain requirements (what
investors will probe)**

**13.1 Why quality is now valuation-relevant**

As products move toward regulated claims, "quality" stops being a
back-office activity and becomes:

- a regulatory requirement,

- a customer requirement (integrators, veterinarians, retailers),

- and an enforcement risk reducer.

The Synergy warning letter highlights how FDA tied unapproved drug
status to CGMP failures (no quality unit, no testing, no batch records).
That is a strong diligence signal for investors.

**13.2 Practical quality system elements to implement**

- Supplier qualification and incoming testing

- Written specifications and COA verification

- Batch records and traceability

- Stability program (real-time and accelerated)

- Label control and content review workflow

- Complaint handling and adverse event reporting where applicable

- Channel partner compliance controls (distributors, affiliates,
  resellers)

**14. Go-to-market and compliance operations**

**14.1 The "claims governance" operating model (minimum viable)**

- Single owner of claims library (regulatory or quality)

- Pre-approved claims bank by product and jurisdiction

- Mandatory review of all marketing assets (web, reseller copy, PDFs)

- Training for sales and customer support

- Auditing of distributor and affiliate pages quarterly

- Written corrective action process when violations occur

**14.2 Post-market monitoring is becoming normal**

EU phage authorization shows post-market monitoring requirements can be
embedded in authorization conditions, especially for resistance-related
concerns.

**15. Investment implications: diligence questions, deal structures, and
"regulatory moat" logic**

**15.1 What a "regulatory moat" looks like in diligence**

Investors will ask:

- What exact claims are being made, and where (including third parties)?

- Which lane are you in (food, additive, drug), and what is the written
  basis?

- Do you have a substantiation dossier for every claim?

- Have you had any FDA, state, or other regulatory inquiries?

- Is manufacturing audit-ready (batch records, testing, CAPA,
  stability)?

- Are you exposed on residues or withdrawal times if food animals?

- What is your defensibility: approvals, exclusivity, patents, trade
  secrets, data?

Multimin 90 is a case study in how approvals and exclusivity/patent
listings can change defensibility and competitive posture.

**15.2 Deal structuring recommendations (practical)**

- Tie earnouts to regulatory milestones (submission accepted,
  authorization granted, label claim granted).

- Include reps/warranties on marketing claims and channel partner
  controls.

- Require disclosure of all marketing assets and reseller pages in
  diligence.

- Add covenants requiring a claim governance system within 60 to 90 days
  post-close.

**16. 2025 to 2030 outlook: scenarios, triggers, and playbook actions**

**Scenario A: Innovative FEED Act passes (or FDA creates a strong de
facto pathway via guidance)**

Trigger signals:

- movement of H.R.2203 or S.1906 beyond "introduced,"

- publication of Draft GFI 289/291 and subsequent enforcement approach,

- increased use of food additive petitions for gut-only functional
  substances.

Action:

- design studies and claims now to align with "gut-only" mechanisms and
  measurable endpoints.

- build an early FDA engagement plan.

Current status remains introduced (not enacted).

**Scenario B: EU continues authorizing high-impact functionals with
explicit conditions**

Trigger signals:

- more implementing regulations with post-market monitoring
  requirements,

- accelerated authorizations for environmental and food safety outcomes.

Action:

- build EU-first claim strategy when your product fits a functional
  group.

- treat post-market monitoring as a core capability, not an
  afterthought.

**Scenario C: Environmental claims become mainstream, and misinformation
risk rises**

Trigger signals:

- more public controversies similar to Bovaer, heightened scrutiny on
  "chemicals in food chain," and reputational risks.

Action:

- pre-build a transparent science communication package:

  - safety narrative,

  - handling guidance,

  - residue and food safety summaries,

  - and third-party validation where possible.
