**The Bifurcation of Value: A Financial & Strategic Appraisal**
This report addresses one core allocation problem: animal nutraceuticals no longer operate as one market, but as two economic systems with different value-creation logic, risk profile, and exit pathways [S089, Tab: Figure 4; S089, Tab: Figure 39]. The first system is companion-animal therapeutic and preventive demand, where pricing power is linked to evidence, trust, and channel control; the second is livestock and premix-linked biological efficiency, where adoption is tied to measurable productivity and compliance outcomes [S089, Tab: Figure 39; S086].

The document is intentionally structured as a linked three-part decision path. Part I defines investable scope and evidence thresholds, Part II quantifies demand and behavioral mechanics, and Part III translates those findings into value-chain capture, transaction logic, and forward-looking strategic scenarios.
