# PART III: The Value Chain Favours Vertical Integration

Part III converts Parts I and II into executable strategy: where value accrues across the chain, which transaction patterns are durable, and which forward scenarios are most material for 2026-2035 positioning.

## III.1. The Value Chain Privileges IP Holders

**Conclusion: Value capture is structurally asymmetric and consistently rewards control points rather than interchangeable volume.**
Upstream science, branded formulation control, and specialized manufacturing continue to capture superior economics relative to undifferentiated downstream resale [S089, Tab: Figure 36; S089, Tab: Figure 39]. In operating terms, the middle layer compresses when claims are weakly protected, while integrated science-plus-channel models preserve margin integrity over cycle turns [S089, Tab: Figure 36].

**Conclusion: Channel architecture is now a direct valuation variable, not a distribution afterthought.**
The downstream split retained from v19 remains decision-relevant: pet-side value is captured through trust, adherence, and omnichannel control, while livestock-side value is captured through measurable biological performance and procurement fit [S089, Tab: Figure 39; S060]. Figure 34 is built from comparative channel-economics data and should be read as a warning against pure-play single-channel exposure: when retail/media costs rise and conversion quality decays, DTC-only models can lose margin faster than integrated channel portfolios [S060; S089, Tab: Figure 37].

**Conclusion: Portfolio targeting should prioritize defensible SOM pathways with evidence-backed control points.**
The TAM-to-SAM-to-SOM framing remains the correct decision scaffold for capital deployment [S104; S089, Tab: Figure 4]. The specific legacy SOM point estimate used in prior internal work is retained as a legacy benchmark from v18/v19 source material [S128].

Figures 32-38 should be read jointly as a value-capture diagnostics set: waterfall and smile-curve mechanics, channel sensitivity, risk-reward posture, transaction valuation behavior, and executable opportunity funnel.

## III.2. Consolidation Favors Vertical Titans

**Conclusion: The market is consolidating around a barbell of integrated scale platforms and specialist IP platforms.**
Large integrated incumbents continue to control access-heavy care pathways, while specialist innovators control high-value biological and formulation moats [S115; S118; S117]. This structure leaves weakly differentiated middle-layer assets most exposed to multiple compression, especially when channel access is rented rather than owned [S089, Tab: Figure 39].

**Conclusion: Transaction evidence confirms a durable two-speed valuation regime across pet and livestock exposures.**
Premium outcomes continue to cluster around assets with brand defensibility, manufacturing control, and validated claims, while lower-differentiation or commodity-adjacent deals clear materially lower bands [S118, Table III.1; S115; S125]. The expanded transaction stack from legacy v18 is reinstated below to restore full comparative context for sponsor and strategic behavior across 2018-2025 [S125; S128].

**Conclusion: Sponsor profiling should be treated as a strategic signal layer for future exits and roll-up velocity.**
Investor participation remains heterogeneous by thesis type: channel-consolidation PE, specialist growth investors, and biosolutions/food-tech funds each cluster around different moat types and time horizons [S116, Tab: Sheet1; S128]. The extended investor table is restored below to recover the missing institutional map from prior versions.

## III.3. Deep Tech Defines the Future Frontier

**Conclusion: Outlook quality now depends on evidence governance as much as on technology promise.**
Green-claim institutionalization is tightening the acceptable claim perimeter, especially where lifecycle and substantiation standards are being formalized [S015; S117]. The practical implication is that platforms with auditable evidence stacks, not just sustainability messaging, are likely to retain pricing and distribution access as compliance thresholds rise [S126].

**Conclusion: The highest-optionality frontier combines nutrigenomics, precision-biological formulation, and longevity protocol design.**
Value is shifting toward platforms that can connect mechanism, phenotype, and repeatable delivery economics, with company-level examples ranging from biomarker/data-driven approaches to fermentation-enabled ingredient control [S089, Tab: Figure 18; S114; S127]. Legacy frontier examples from v18 are reinstated below as scenario context [S128].

**Conclusion: Asia AGP scenarios are the largest medium-term upside lever for global TAM re-rating, but dispersion is high and path-dependent.**
The APAC AGP-dividend thesis remains a credible scenario lens: tighter antibiotic constraints in China and India can expand long-run functional additive demand and alter global TAM composition [S124]. The scenario table below is retained from legacy work and should be treated as a directional scenario range [S128].

**Table III.3: Green-Claim Evidence Hierarchy (Ported from v18).**

| Tier | Claim Category | Risk Level | Evidence Requirement | Typical Example | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **5** | Multi-attribute superiority claim | High | Cross-impact superiority with broad third-party proof | "Planet positive" | [S126; S128] |
| **4** | Certified seal claim | Medium | Third-party certification plus chain-of-custody controls | Certified sustainability seal | [S126; S128] |
| **3** | Aggregated footprint claim | Low-Medium | LCA-style quantified footprint with transparent boundaries | Product carbon footprint value | [S126; S128] |
| **2** | Comparative reduction claim | Low-Medium | Baseline-consistent comparison design and reproducible methodology | "30% lower emissions vs benchmark" | [S126; S128] |
| **1** | Specific attribute claim | Lower | Supplier and batch-level traceability documentation | "Contains X% recycled material" | [S126; S128] |

**Table III.4: Asia AGP-Dividend Scenario Lens (Legacy Base Case vs Upside).**

| Geography | Legacy 2024 Baseline | Legacy 2030-2035 Range | Incremental Opportunity | Interpretation | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **China** | ~$2.5B | ~$5.0-6.5B | +$3.0-4.0B | Largest near-term re-rating potential under stricter post-AGP enforcement | [S124; S128] |
| **India** | ~$0.5B | ~$1.5-2.5B | +$1.0-2.0B | Delayed but potentially material second-wave contributor | [S124; S128] |
| **Combined Asia** | ~$3.0B | ~$7.0-9.0B | +$4.0-6.0B | Core upside scenario for global TAM trajectory | [S124; S128] |
