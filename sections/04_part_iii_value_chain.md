# PART III: The Value Chain Favours Vertical Integration

Part III consolidates the missing strategic layers from the legacy draft inside the current three-subpart architecture: value-chain capture, competitive/valuation structure, and forward-looking strategic frontiers.

## III.1. The Value Chain Privileges IP Holders

Value capture remains asymmetric: upstream science, branded formulation control, and specialized manufacturing capabilities capture structurally higher economics than undifferentiated downstream resale [S089, Tab: Figure 36; S089, Tab: Figure 39]. The middle of the chain continues to compress when products lack protectable claims, while IP-linked and channel-integrated models preserve margin integrity [S089, Tab: Figure 36].

The legacy downstream split from v19 (pet "wellness premium" chain vs livestock "efficiency scale" chain) is reintroduced here as a practical operating lens: pet-side value is captured through brand and compliance behavior, while livestock value is captured through measurable biological performance and procurement fit [S089, Tab: Figure 39; S060]. This explains why similar active ingredients can clear materially different economics depending on end-channel and claim architecture [S061; S089, Tab: Figure 37].

The strategic-opportunity framing from v19 is also retained: broad animal-health TAM, narrower nutraceutical SAM, and an execution-level SOM for prioritized platforms [S104; S089, Tab: Figure 4]. The specific "~$250M target SOM" figure used in legacy internal work is not currently backed by a directly citable source file and remains unresolved [UNVERIFIED].

## III.2. Consolidation Favors Vertical Titans

The competitive landscape still fits a barbell structure: large integrated incumbents controlling distribution and care-continuum access on one side, and specialist innovators controlling biological or formulation IP on the other [S115; S118; S117]. The middle layer remains the most exposed to multiple compression where differentiation is weak and substitution risk is high [S089, Tab: Figure 39]. The v19 distribution-gatekeeper layer is reinstated here: corporatized veterinary networks, specialty retail chains, and scaled e-commerce platforms (including IVC Evidensia, Zooplus, PetSmart, and Musti) increasingly mediate demand access [S116, Tab: Sheet1].

Transaction evidence supports this consolidation logic. High-quality assets with brand defensibility, channel access, or manufacturing optionality continue to attract premium outcomes, as reflected by benchmark transactions including Zesty Paws and NaturVet and the Zoetis MFA divestiture [S118, Table III.1; S115]. The broader v19 transaction stack is reinstated in this version (including Blue Buffalo, Neovia, Erber Group, Nom Nom, and Aker BioMarine Feed Ingredients) as a historical map of where strategic and sponsor capital has concentrated [S125]. Legacy platform signals around Vetnique-Lintbells (YuMOVE) and FoodScience are also carried forward for continuity, with sponsor mapping tied to the in-repo PE/VC portfolio file [S116, Tab: Sheet1] and unresolved valuation specifics retained as unverified [UNVERIFIED]. The v19 two-speed multiple framing (Pet roughly 15x-25x EBITDA versus Livestock/Feed roughly 8x-12x EBITDA) is reinstated as a directional benchmark pending direct source remapping [S125].

Valuation dispersion remains linked to four recurring drivers: evidence depth, channel control, platform scalability, and regulatory optionality [S118, Table III.1; S089, Tab: Figure 39]. The v19 investor-profile layer is now explicitly reinstated with mapped examples from the internal portfolio registry: JAB (NVA, Ethos), Gryphon (Vetnique, Lintbells/YuMOVE), MSCP (FoodScience), EQT (IVC Evidensia, Zooplus, Dechra), BC Partners (PetSmart, Gambol), Cinven (Partner in Pet Food, Arcaplanet), and Ani.VC (early-stage specialist exposure) [S116, Tab: Sheet1]. Legacy buyer-mix assumptions (for example, high PE/financial participation in pet transactions versus higher strategic participation in livestock/feed) remain unresolved until deal-by-deal coding is fully source-bound [S125]. Legacy IPO optionality language is retained for strategic completeness, but explicit IPO comp tables are not currently source-mapped in this repository [UNVERIFIED]. Legacy AUM tiers and investor-size rankings shown in v19 are also retained as unresolved until fund-level reporting sources are attached [UNVERIFIED].

## III.3. Deep Tech Defines the Future Frontier

Green-claim institutionalization is moving from marketing language toward regulated, auditable claim stacks in selected jurisdictions, which raises the evidentiary bar but also increases defensibility for scaled platforms with documentation depth [S015; S117]. The legacy v19 "evidence hierarchy for green labels" is carried forward as a useful operating framework, but its tier definitions remain to be fully source-linked [S126].

Nutrigenomics, precision-biological formulation, and longevity-linked protocols remain the highest-optionality frontier. The core investment idea is unchanged: value migrates toward platforms that can connect molecular mechanism, measurable phenotype, and durable channel adoption [S089, Tab: Figure 18; S114]. Gene-editing adjacency and lifespan-extension pathway assumptions from prior drafts are retained as directional themes pending explicit citation completion [S127].

The APAC AGP-dividend scenario from v19 is also preserved as a strategic outlook lens: tighter antibiotic constraints in China and India could expand long-run functional additive demand and alter global TAM composition [S124]. Until those scenario tables are fully source-bound, they should remain in the unresolved-claims workflow, while current investment roadmap decisions stay anchored to sourced economics in Parts I–III [S104; S089, Tab: Figure 39].
